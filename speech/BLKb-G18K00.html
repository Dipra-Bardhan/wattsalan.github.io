<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m00s">Now there is really nothing radically wrong with being sick or dying. Who said you supposed</a> 00:00:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m07s">to survive ? Who gave you the idea that it is a gas to go and on and on?</a> 00:00:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m14s">And we can not say that it is a good thing for everything to live on. In very</a> 00:00:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m19s">simple demonstration that if we are able to keep everyone alive, we overload ourselves</a> 00:00:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m23s">and we are pruned like a tree.</a> 00:00:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m27s">And, therefore, a person who dies in a way is honorable, because he makes room for it</a> 00:00:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m36s">others ... Although each of us, individually, will naturally appreciate as someone</a> 00:00:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m42s">saves our lives, if we apply that case around we can see that it is not workable.</a> 00:00:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m49s">We can also look further and see that if our death can become indefinite</a> 00:00:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h00m58s">postponed, we would not actually go on postponement indefinitely, because after</a> 00:00:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m09s">a certain point we would realize that is not the way we wanted to survive</a> 00:01:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m18s">.</a> 00:01:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m19s">Why do we have children differently? Because children arrange for us to survive on another</a> 00:01:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m24s">way through, as it were, the passing of a flashlight, so you do not have to carry</a> 00:01:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m28s">all the time . There comes a point where you can give it and say now that you are working.</a> 00:01:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m35s">It is a lot of fun for nature to continue the process of life through different ones</a> 00:01:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m42s">individuals then it is always with the same person, because every new individual will live</a> 00:01:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m50s">renewed. And one realizes how fascinating the most everyday things are to a child</a> 00:01:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h01m54s">because they see them all as beautiful - because they see them all in a way</a> 00:01:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m02s">that is not related to survival and profit.</a> 00:02:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m07s">When we think of everything in terms of survival and profit value, like us</a> 00:02:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m18s">do not have the forms of scratches on the floor of magic anymore. And most</a> 00:02:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m29s">things, in fact, cease to have magic.</a> 00:02:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m33s">So therefore, in the course of nature, once we have ceased to magic more</a> 00:02:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m40s">to see in the world, no more game fulfilling nature is aware of it.</a> 00:02:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m47s">There is no point in it any longer.</a> 00:02:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m52s">And so we die.</a> 00:02:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h02m55s">And so something else comes to birth, for which a completely new view is given</a> 00:02:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h03m01s">. And so nature's self-awareness is a game worth the candle.</a> 00:03:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h03m07s">So it is not natural for us to want to live indefinitely. But</a> 00:03:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h03m15s">we live in a culture where it is rubbed in us in every way possible to die</a> 00:03:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h03m22s">is a terrible thing. That is a huge disease that our culture, especially, suffers from</a> 00:03:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h03m26s">.</a> 00:03:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h03m27s">And we personally notice it in the way death is swept under the carpet</a> 00:03:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h03m39s">. And, so a person is left to die alone, suddenly, unprepared</a> 00:03:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLKb-G18K00#t=00h03m45s">, and doped to the point where death hardly happens.</a> 00:03:45</p>
