<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m25s">He ran away from him.</a> 00:00:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m27s">All his neighbors attended that night</a> 00:00:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m30s">They said: &quot;This is very bad&quot;</a> 00:00:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m32s">Then he said to them, &quot;Maybe&quot;</a> 00:00:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m35s">The next day the horse returned and brought seven horses with him.</a> 00:00:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m41s">The neighbors came back and said, &quot;That's great, is not it?&quot; And he said to them, &quot;Maybe&quot;</a> 00:00:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m48s">The next day he was the son of the farmer</a> 00:00:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m50s">One of the horses is riding, trying to tame her, but she threw him away and fell and his leg was broken.</a> 00:00:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h00m57s">The neighbors gathered again and told the farmer: &quot;This is bad, is not it?&quot; The farmer said, &quot;Maybe.&quot;</a> 00:00:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h01m05s">The following day, conscription officers attended the search for people to be recruited into the army.</a> 00:01:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h01m09s">They refused his son's joining the army because of his broken leg. He attended all the neighbors that evening and told the farmer: &quot;Is not that wonderful?&quot;</a> 00:01:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h01m16s">And he said to them: &quot;Maybe&quot; &quot;chuckle&quot;</a> 00:01:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h01m24s">The methodology of life as a whole is a complex process of enormous complexity.</a> 00:01:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h01m32s">It's impossible to say anything that might happen in your life: &quot;Is it good or bad?&quot;</a> 00:01:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h01m39s">Because you can never know what the consequences will be because of bad luck.</a> 00:01:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0OARBqBp0#t=00h01m45s">Or you never know what the consequences might be because of good fortune.</a> 00:01:45</p>
