<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h00m32s">I will tell you the order, and the most important things one begins to know to practice zen meditation, which is called zazen.</a> 00:00:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h00m45s">First I will explain how to place your legs.</a> 00:00:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h00m51s">A seat cushion is good if it is comfortable and thick.</a> 00:00:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h01m01s">The height of the pillow is adjusted after the development of the practitioner's zazen.</a> 00:01:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h01m14s">Now I want to explain how to place your legs.</a> 00:01:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h01m23s">This way of placing the legs is called the &quot;lotus position&quot; - you cross the legs.</a> 00:01:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h01m29s">You do it by</a> 00:01:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h01m33s">First place your right foot on your left inner thigh,</a> 00:01:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h01m40s">Then place your left foot on your right inner thigh.</a> 00:01:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h01m48s">This is called the lotus position.</a> 00:01:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h01m54s">If you can't do that, you can sit asymmetrically: place the right foot on the left thigh,</a> 00:01:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h02m05s">Or left foot on the right thigh - either or.</a> 00:02:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h02m13s">Both the left foot and the right foot are fine, both positions are correct, but the important thing is,</a> 00:02:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h02m22s">The waist should not be bent backwards and the waist and back should not bend.</a> 00:02:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h02m27s">the waist must be held firmly in the middle; a straight spine is very important in our sitting position</a> 00:02:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h02m53s">Once you have crossed your legs, turn your right palm up and place your hand on the legs.</a> 00:02:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m04s">Left hand put in right hand, also with palm upwards.</a> 00:03:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m10s">Thumbs are held softly against each other.</a> 00:03:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m17s">This is the circle known from zazen.</a> 00:03:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m24s">With the two thumbs a circle is formed.</a> 00:03:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m30s">This is not what beginners often find difficult at first,</a> 00:03:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m35s">it is more to keep the posture, to preserve the shape,</a> 00:03:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m40s">So, you can also hold your hands thus.</a> 00:03:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m46s">But the foundation of zazen is this;</a> 00:03:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m50s">To shape the circle - that is the foundation.</a> 00:03:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h03m57s">If someone practices zazen for a long time and becomes familiar with it,</a> 00:03:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m00s">they will eventually understand the importance of this position.</a> 00:04:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m04s">If you manage to cross your legs like this and your hands are as they should,</a> 00:04:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m12s">then pull your waist slightly forward just above the tailbone so that the tail does not bend backwards.</a> 00:04:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m22s">In this way, the spine will position itself in the middle.</a> 00:04:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m29s">It feels the same way as pushing your buttocks slightly backwards.</a> 00:04:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m34s">In this position, we stretch our lives, stretch our spine,</a> 00:04:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m40s">and gently we pull in the chin.</a> 00:04:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m42s">It feels like we are raising the sky with the top of our head.</a> 00:04:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h04m51s">It is not good if you lean to the side with right or left shoulder.</a> 00:04:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m00s">To make the right and left remain parallel,</a> 00:05:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m08s">Keep the line of ears and shoulders horizontal.</a> 00:05:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m11s">And also keep the line of nose and navel vertical,</a> 00:05:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m16s">if the area between the belly button and the nose, especially the abdomen, is not slightly advanced,</a> 00:05:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m25s">Our position will not be as we wish.</a> 00:05:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m27s">So we pull the chin in and raise the sky gently with the top of the head,</a> 00:05:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m35s">And in that position, the spine becomes almost straight.</a> 00:05:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m40s">Then we look over the nose back,</a> 00:05:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m46s">about a meter in front of us in a natural way.</a> 00:05:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h05m55s">Even if you don't have to strain your eyes</a> 00:05:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m00s">Don't close them.</a> 00:06:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m02s">It is because we practice zazen to silence our mind or rather make it more functional,</a> 00:06:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m12s">we are not just sitting here.</a> 00:06:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m15s">In our daily lives, our eyes are open, so zazen must also be a help to it.</a> 00:06:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m23s">Therefore, as much as possible, we must keep our eyes open, so that our vision,</a> 00:06:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m30s">In a natural way, the field of vision involves us.</a> 00:06:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m36s">Attention is in our left palm; we we put the palms together in such a way,</a> 00:06:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m43s">that we can place the attention in our palm.</a> 00:06:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m45s">Or we can focus attention in the belly about 5 centimeters below the navel.</a> 00:06:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m54s">So we can focus attention on one of these two places.</a> 00:06:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h06m58s">The reason why attention and location are different is,</a> 00:06:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m02s">that although the focus of the eyes is natural, the center is where the attention is.</a> 00:07:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m09s">One can also say that the place of attention becomes the center of zazen.</a> 00:07:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m20s">In this way, we receive the chi of heaven, the energy of heaven, through our heads,</a> 00:07:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m28s">and pulling the earth's chi, the earth's energy, from below,</a> 00:07:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m32s">and these two energies unite in the belly:</a> 00:07:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m39s">This teaching is the basis of zazen.</a> 00:07:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m44s">Thus, we have now got the shape in place.</a> 00:07:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m50s">Whatever the shape is correct, if your mind is not as it should be,</a> 00:07:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h07m58s">If your mind has not become more balanced then you yourself will be in a real sitting position</a> 00:07:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h08m04s">Don't find peace.</a> 00:08:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h08m06s">Being able to gather the mind: That's what is difficult.</a> 00:08:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h08m11s">It is about clarifying the formless consciousness;</a> 00:08:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h08m15s">Those who have become familiar with it understand it, but those who do not, it is difficult for them.</a> 00:08:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h08m23s">To customize the mind, the mindless mind, it is an important tool</a> 00:08:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h08m32s">to keep hold of the breath, because we thereby also gradually get the mind at rest.</a> 00:08:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h08m42s">Getting control of the breathing means we are sitting in zazen in this way,</a> 00:08:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h08m50s">and that we release the forces and tensions throughout the upper body: the shoulders, neck muscles and chest.</a> 00:08:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m01s">We relax the upper part of our body.</a> 00:09:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m04s">Particularly important is the site under the ribs, which is called the diaphragm (the muscle between the chest and the abdomen) and the site where the esophagus enters the stomach.</a> 00:09:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m09s">It is the place that is most easily tense.</a> 00:09:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m14s">If it doesn't open, we can't breathe deeply.</a> 00:09:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m20s">When we cannot breathe deeply, it means that chi, the energy, is stuck in its upper part of the body.</a> 00:09:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m25s">Therefore, we think a lot about daily, and are preoccupied with the outer world,</a> 00:09:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m35s">and no matter what we do, chi or energy rises lightly.</a> 00:09:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m39s">When we all the way through life is in such a state,</a> 00:09:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m45s">the entrance of the esophagus into the stomach and diaphragm becomes very tight and tight.</a> 00:09:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m53s">And then our diaphragm moves reluctantly, even though we breathe.</a> 00:09:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h09m59s">This happens very easily, or rather it is very common.</a> 00:09:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h10m04s">That is why it is so important in zazen to breathe into the belly</a> 00:10:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h10m11s">which enables us to breathe more perfectly by using the diaphragm and stomach.</a> 00:10:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h10m19s">The exhalation relaxes our body.</a> 00:10:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h10m24s">And the inhalation calls back vitality, a sense of fullness, energy and bodily activity.</a> 00:10:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h10m38s">Once we have understood these principles regarding the body's breath,</a> 00:10:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h10m43s">Then breathe out as far and slowly as possible.</a> 00:10:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h10m49s">If we can do that, our body will gradually relax and our minds also find rest.</a> 00:10:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h10m56s">We often try to climb inhalation,</a> 00:10:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h11m02s">But it is not very good.</a> 00:11:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h11m05s">Let your body breathe in as much as possible.</a> 00:11:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h11m09s">The way to breathe that helps with this is the following:</a> 00:11:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h11m13s">During zazen, we usually do not breathe through our mouths.</a> 00:11:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h11m21s">We both breathe in and breathe out through the nose.</a> 00:11:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h11m25s">Since this is not quite easy to understand, I will now simply breathe out through my mouth and show it by hand.</a> 00:11:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h11m39s">Exhaling.</a> 00:11:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m11s">If we relax the upper part of the body, the stomach always pulls in when we breathe out.</a> 00:12:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m20s">The reason for this lies in the body's nature.</a> 00:12:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m23s">The stomach retracts and we can breathe out until the abdomen cannot contract more.</a> 00:12:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m32s">It lasts about 8 to 10 seconds,</a> 00:12:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m37s">about 8 seconds.</a> 00:12:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m39s">To aim for an 8-second exhale is fine, I think.</a> 00:12:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m46s">If you become familiar with it, you will be able to breathe out for as long as 20 or 30 seconds.</a> 00:12:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m52s">But before you become familiar with doing this correctly, it is difficult.</a> 00:12:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h12m55s">Incidentally, on a daily basis you do not even have to do such a thing.</a> 00:12:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h13m01s">If we aim for 8 seconds, the mind comes to rest gradually.</a> 00:13:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h13m10s">Thus, the exhalation.</a> 00:13:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h13m37s">If we breathe out until we can't do more, and the stomach can't pull together,</a> 00:13:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h13m44s">wants the body to return to its original state.</a> 00:13:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h13m48s">The stomach, the contracted stomach that wants to return to its original state,</a> 00:13:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h13m53s">yields to the force that wants to bring it back to its former state,</a> 00:13:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h13m57s">obey the natural, alluring power and breathe in again.</a> 00:13:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h14m02s">Under no circumstances should we force breathing in.</a> 00:14:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h14m05s">The body breathes in by itself, that's all.</a> 00:14:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h14m14s">These are the most important things about the proper breathing and the right zazen for beginners.</a> 00:14:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h14m24s">By practicing this way, the aim is to prolong the exhalation in a natural way,</a> 00:14:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h14m30s">as long as possible, for 8 or 10 seconds;</a> 00:14:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h14m42s">and breathing, if possible, should not end with the first breathing,</a> 00:14:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h14m49s">but instead, breathing should last for 5 minutes, 10 minutes if possible</a> 00:14:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h14m53s">And then, once you become familiar with it, you can concentrate on extending the zazen time to 30 minutes or an hour.</a> 00:14:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h15m04s">To achieve this, we must draw our attention to the breath,</a> 00:15:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h15m09s">the exhalation and attention become one,</a> 00:15:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h15m13s">and in this way we get the habit of breathing, or rather we get the mind on the mind.</a> 00:15:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h15m19s">It is the way we practice.</a> 00:15:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h15m22s">I can also point to a method called breathing that sharpen the concentration on the breath.</a> 00:15:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h15m31s">We count the breaths,</a> 00:15:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h15m34s">Such a....</a> 00:15:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h16m03s">When the stomach is completely contracted, the body breathes in.</a> 00:16:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h16m11s">And then: Two ....</a> 00:16:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h16m35s">I breathe again.</a> 00:16:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h16m39s">That way: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.</a> 00:16:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h16m49s">When you reach ten, you start over again.</a> 00:16:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h16m53s">The whole point is to do it with a fresh, present attitude, with an awareness as if we just sat down.</a> 00:16:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h17m04s">In other words, be aware: don't let the count become a routine - keep sharpening your attention.</a> 00:17:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h17m12s">This is very important in zazen.</a> 00:17:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h17m14s">In this way, we gradually expand our breathing, and gradually the number of breaths becomes stable,</a> 00:17:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h17m23s">or better said, the peaceful state becomes part of ourselves in a natural way.</a> 00:17:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h17m29s">The mind becomes more balanced and no longer loses in unnecessary thoughts.</a> 00:17:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h17m46s">We can also call this state a unit of body and mind.</a> 00:17:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h17m50s">If the body finds rest, the mind also finds rest.</a> 00:17:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h17m55s">And the mind, just as the body sits firmly here, roots right here in this present.</a> 00:17:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h18m05s">Our mind or what we call mind .... there are many names for it, but now I want to use the word &quot;mind&quot;.</a> 00:18:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h18m16s">We have many different kinds of thoughts.</a> 00:18:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h18m21s">Something about the past. Something about the future. Something about people. And unusual, strange thoughts.</a> 00:18:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h18m27s">There are many different things that produce thoughts in our minds.</a> 00:18:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h18m35s">And the mind follows them; This means that the mind jumps from one to the other all the time.</a> 00:18:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h18m42s">Even when we want to do a job that is important to us and start on it,</a> 00:18:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h18m52s">the work will be of lesser value because the mind is constantly dissipated by other things.</a> 00:18:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h18m57s">However, if the body is at rest, the mind will also find complete peace.</a> 00:18:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h19m03s">In a moment, the mind also falls to rest.</a> 00:19:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h19m07s">If the body stands up, the mind follows it as a shadow and stands up with it.</a> 00:19:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h19m13s">If the body goes, the mind goes with it and follows it.</a> 00:19:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h19m20s">And thus, if we work, the mind also works, and when we live daily life, it also lives with us.</a> 00:19:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h19m27s">Getting the mind on the mind means that it follows us closely in all life situations.</a> 00:19:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h19m36s">In this way, the mind obeys us at any time in all the different situations.</a> 00:19:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h19m44s">When body and mind are closely linked,</a> 00:19:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h19m52s">And when we sit like that, we really feel that a great serenity fills us.</a> 00:19:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m02s">On the other hand, when we work, we see and hear and experience many different things,</a> 00:20:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m08s">and our minds are scattered as you say.</a> 00:20:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m13s">Our balance is disturbed.</a> 00:20:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m15s">But if we have already become familiar with zazen,</a> 00:20:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m19s">so our state of mind will no longer change as easily, whether we work or sit in zazen.</a> 00:20:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m30s">When we talk about this state, we say: The practice of the place has no limits.</a> 00:20:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m36s">We can hardly see the difference between moving, working or sitting in silence.</a> 00:20:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m46s">Such is the balanced mind.</a> 00:20:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m50s">With such a mind, we gain a broader perspective, a perspective on the environment.</a> 00:20:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h20m56s">It is one of the most important things about zazen.</a> 00:20:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m00s">Therefore, we not only seek our own happiness,</a> 00:21:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m04s">Instead, we quietly consider the surrounding circumstances,</a> 00:21:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m07s">and perceive the environment as our companion, and is able to maintain a calm and peaceful state.</a> 00:21:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m18s">Zazen is about developing such a humanity.</a> 00:21:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m22s">Only seeking our own happiness is therefore not zazen.</a> 00:21:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m28s">Getting the mind on the mind is therefore a way in which it becomes the basis of our entire life,</a> 00:21:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m37s">it is zazen.</a> 00:21:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m39s">Therefore, zazen is first the body posture and the natural way of breathing, a deep and rich path</a> 00:21:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h21m51s">but also a state of mind, whereby the mind is completely connected to the state of the body at a particular time and place.</a> 00:21:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h22m02s">If you achieve this in a natural way, I think one can better understand what zazen is.</a> 00:22:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2XUTeoUsM#t=00h22m12s">With this in mind, I hope with all my heart that zazen will send deep roots into your life.</a> 00:22:12</p>
