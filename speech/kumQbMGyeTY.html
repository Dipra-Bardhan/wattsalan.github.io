<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h00m36s">specific and particular experience which is of the utmost fascination</a> 00:00:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h00m44s">it's the kind of experience which I suppose we would ordinarily call mystical or</a> 00:00:44</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h01m21s">perhaps you know the story of the investigator who took doses of anaesthetic for this purpose and</a> 00:01:21</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h01m34s">To record at the moment of awakening what ever revelation might have been given to him</a> 00:01:34</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h01m47s">and</a> 00:01:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h01m48s">for a brief period The Investigator had the Vivid conviction of</a> 00:01:48</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h01m59s">He regained waking consciousness</a> 00:01:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m02s">With the tail end of the sensation still upon him</a> 00:02:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m05s">Grabbed the pencil and swiftly recorded the essential content of the experience just before it faded</a> 00:02:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m15s">after several minutes during which his mind</a> 00:02:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m19s">Returned to its normal state</a> 00:02:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m23s">he looked at what he had written and</a> 00:02:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m27s">Thereupon the paper was the Following immensely profound observation</a> 00:02:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m34s">Everything in this universe is the smell of burnt almonds [I]</a> 00:02:34</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m48s">That all sensible and hard-headed people would agree [that] this is just the sort of inanity</a> 00:02:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h02m55s">to which all these mystical revelations ultimately boiled down</a> 00:02:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m01s">in the clear cold light [of] Rational consciousness</a> 00:03:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m06s">the seemingly inspired and utter convincing knowledge of</a> 00:03:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m12s">dreams of</a> 00:03:12</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m17s">of mystical experiences comes down to just this sort of idiotic, Anticlimax</a> 00:03:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m23s">masked in the poetic or exotic obscurantism of such phrases as all is Brahman or</a> 00:03:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m30s">the Divine Unity beneath the multiplicity [of] [the] world</a> 00:03:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m33s">it may sound for a moment as if</a> 00:03:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m36s">It meant something</a> 00:03:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m39s">But the essential nonsense of these feelings, and the purely subjective character of the sense of insight which they involve</a> 00:03:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m47s">at once becomes obvious when</a> 00:03:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m50s">Brahman or the Divine unity</a> 00:03:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h03m53s">Is replaced by the smell of burnt almonds?</a> 00:03:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m00s">We might settle for this conclusion</a> 00:04:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m04s">If some of us had not had the same sensation</a> 00:04:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m09s">not under drugs or hypnosis, but when very [wide-awake] and</a> 00:04:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m17s">[I] for one will not quarrel with the smell of burnt almonds as the key to the mystery</a> 00:04:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m24s">I like it much [better] and feel it makes much more sense than [Rothman] or the divine unity</a> 00:04:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m33s">And for it's very banality</a> 00:04:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m36s">It's very once equational silliness</a> 00:04:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m39s">brings out the real significance of the experience in question</a> 00:04:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m45s">for the importance of</a> 00:04:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m49s">the mystical revelation</a> 00:04:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m51s">Does not lie in the precise nature of what?</a> 00:04:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m56s">everything in this universe is</a> 00:04:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h04m58s">It can be god or Brahman or burnt almonds or applesauce or anything you like?</a> 00:04:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m04s">its importance lies rather</a> 00:05:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m08s">in the simple sensation of wholeness in the part of the sentence which runs</a> 00:05:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m14s">Everything in this [universe] is no matter what?</a> 00:05:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m22s">For the conviction which has come to the experiencer?</a> 00:05:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m31s">is that his habitual sensation of</a> 00:05:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m35s">isolation from his environment [from] the rest of the world is an illusion and that</a> 00:05:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m42s">Has a caller corollary?</a> 00:05:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m45s">his own deeds and misdeeds fortunes and misfortunes are</a> 00:05:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m51s">the same process as</a> 00:05:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h05m56s">the changing Seasons and the circling Stars and</a> 00:05:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h06m03s">Unreasonable as it may seem this gives him the sensation that his whole life past present and future</a> 00:06:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h06m12s">[is] somehow Perfectly natural and in order and</a> 00:06:12</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h06m23s">about the total process of the world</a> 00:06:23</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h06m37s">Lie in any consequences or conclusions which might be drawn from it?</a> 00:06:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h06m44s">It is not an important experience in the sense that it is useful for some other purpose</a> 00:06:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h06m53s">It's simply like playing or listening to music</a> 00:06:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h06m58s">which is obviously phony in the very moment that we do it for some ulterior motive such as</a> 00:06:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h07m05s">to appear cultured or</a> 00:07:05</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h07m12s">Its significance for human beings is not like that. I'll say the second law of thermodynamics</a> 00:07:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h07m21s">but like that of the Mozart Sonatas or</a> 00:07:21</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h10m34s">It's very very much stronger</a> 00:10:34</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m13s">Let me remind you I'll the celebrated tale that was told by Sri Ramakrishna</a> 00:12:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m21s">the story of One of his disciples</a> 00:12:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m24s">who had learned from the Master that all the multiplicity [of] this world is the</a> 00:12:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m33s">Illusory Outward form of the one Eternal Divine Brahman</a> 00:12:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m40s">Underlying the entire process and having sat and listened to this</a> 00:12:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m46s">exposition the disciple and got up and went his way and</a> 00:12:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m50s">In passing down a rather Narrow Street</a> 00:12:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m53s">he saw an elephant coming towards him and</a> 00:12:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h12m57s">Mahute riding on top of the elephant</a> 00:12:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m01s">Well the mahute saw the disciple wandering down the center of the road and shouted at him</a> 00:13:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m07s">Hey, you get out of the way this elephant isn't very nice</a> 00:13:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m12s">But the disciple thought now the master</a> 00:13:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m15s">Ramakrishna has told me that I am brahman and that everything is Brahman and therefore the elephant is Brahman and</a> 00:13:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m21s">Therefore it will be perfectly all right if I walk straight along the elephant will do me no harm</a> 00:13:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m25s">Since I realized this to be true</a> 00:13:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m29s">so he ignored the warning of the mahute and</a> 00:13:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m35s">approached the elephant and</a> 00:13:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m37s">The elephants one his trunk and swatted that disciple hard and threw him into the ditch where he was scratched with the brambles</a> 00:13:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m46s">Well he was very upset and he came crawling back [to] Sri Ramakrishna and said master you</a> 00:13:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m54s">Have deceived me I</a> 00:13:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h13m59s">Understood that everything is Brahman that I am Brahman all other creatures is that not so Master and the master said yes</a> 00:13:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m07s">it is so</a> 00:14:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m08s">well, he said I was walking out in the road, and I saw this elephant coming towards me and</a> 00:14:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m13s">It didn't seem to me to be</a> 00:14:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m15s">Necessary to get out of the way when the mahute riding the elephant warned me to do so because I figured that I was Brahman</a> 00:14:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m20s">And the elephant was robbing and I could come to no harm</a> 00:14:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m25s">You stupid man said tree Ramakrishna</a> 00:14:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m29s">You didn't realize that the voice of the mahute was also Brahmand, and you should have heeded that too</a> 00:14:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m40s">so also in this case</a> 00:14:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m44s">The one who is trying</a> 00:14:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m47s">to regain the vision is the disciple and</a> 00:14:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m51s">The vision they are trying to regain is the elephant</a> 00:14:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h14m57s">but the way you are actually feeling now and</a> 00:14:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m06s">which you are ignoring because of your eagerness to feel some other way that [is] the voice of the mahute and</a> 00:15:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m14s">That too is Brahman</a> 00:15:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m21s">nine times out of [ten] an</a> 00:15:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m25s">observation of this kind</a> 00:15:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m28s">Will mean nothing?</a> 00:15:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m30s">And will fall as flat as being told that everything in this [universe] is the smell of burnt almonds</a> 00:15:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m40s">but the tenth time</a> 00:15:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m43s">It will dawn upon you as a statement of total and luminous clarity I</a> 00:15:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h15m53s">Do not think we need have any fear that this tenth time will never come</a> 00:15:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h16m00s">For in other circumstances it has come again and again think back to school days</a> 00:16:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h16m09s">When with the utmost care your teacher explained over and over?</a> 00:16:09</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h16m21s">you consistently failed to see the point and</a> 00:16:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h16m26s">then suddenly something clicked in your mind and</a> 00:16:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumQbMGyeTY#t=00h16m31s">the principal became clear</a> 00:16:31</p>
