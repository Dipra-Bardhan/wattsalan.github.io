<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h00m14s">In the Bay of San Francisco, a village named Sausalito.</a> 00:00:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h00m24s">An old stranded boathouse called Vallejo.</a> 00:00:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h00m37s">A meeting. The philosopher, Alan Watts.</a> 00:00:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h00m48s">Alan Watts, how might one define you?</a> 00:00:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h00m50s">How do you bite your own teeth?</a> 00:00:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h00m53s">Really, I don't know who I am... because... I do feel that everyone of us, basically, is the energy of the whole universe.</a> 00:00:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h01m17s">I am a philosopher which means a person who finds existence itself marvellous and extraordinary...</a> 00:01:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h01m24s">... and therefore wants to find out what this is.</a> 00:01:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h01m50s">The philosopher Alan Watts has been a kind of guru of the Hippy movement.</a> 00:01:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h01m53s">Today, he remains one of the great thinkers of the younger generation.</a> 00:01:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h01m58s">He has written more than 20 books, a lot of which having been translated into French, and it is he, this former Anglican priest-turned-Buddhist</a> 00:01:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h02m05s">who has introduced Oriental philosophy and mysticism to younger generations.</a> 00:02:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h02m33s">When did you start coming to the attention of American audiences?</a> 00:02:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h02m38s">Well, that's when I published a book called 'The Way of Zen'.</a> 00:02:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h02m42s">It was in 1956 when I published this book and for some reason or other, at that time, there was what is called popularly the 'Zen boom'.</a> 00:02:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h02m50s">And my book rode in on the crest of that wave.</a> 00:02:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h02m54s">Artists, poets and so on were all interested in Zen Buddhism at that time.</a> 00:02:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h03m09s">A few years ago, you were very involved in the youth movement in California. Are you still?</a> 00:03:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h03m15s">Well naturally I remain very closely in touch with them all across the country because so much of my work is lecturing in colleges and universities</a> 00:03:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h03m25s">You know, I was the...a Chaplain at Northwestern University between 1944 and 1950</a> 00:03:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h03m32s">And I am absolutely amazed how the intellectual quality of our universities has changed over the years...</a> 00:03:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h03m41s">... because when I was Chaplain at Northwest, most of the young men were in fraternities, the women were in sororities</a> 00:03:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h03m50s">and their primary interests were in football, in dating and in drinking.</a> 00:03:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h03m55s">There was no interest whatsoever in... I mean, I could not possibly have brought 4,000 students together to meditate.</a> 00:03:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h04m04s">A kind of yoga or chant or taking part in a course on Oriental philosophy.</a> 00:04:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h04m09s">Now, they turn out in droves. The atmosphere of university is completely different and I can't believe it.</a> 00:04:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h04m15s">It's as if I've pressed a button expecting a buzz and I've got an explosion.</a> 00:04:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h04m51s">Can you say more about what really attracted you to Oriental philosophy and religions?</a> 00:04:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h04m57s">Well...</a> 00:04:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h04m58s">Yes!</a> 00:04:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h05m00s">I have found, throughout my experience of Christianity and Judaism, that they are very talkative; they're didactic. They're services, for example.</a> 00:05:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h05m15s">At the mass, or at other forms of Christian or Jewish worship, they're always telling God what to do, as if he didn't know.</a> 00:05:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h05m23s">And they tell the people what to do as if they would or could.</a> 00:05:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h05m26s">They talk, talk, talk incessantly, and it's all up here. There is no spiritual experience in the sense of something more gut-sy... more... deep rather than just thought about.</a> 00:05:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h05m42s">And so I feel that, for lack of that, these religions are lacking spiritual power.</a> 00:05:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h05m49s">It's all very well to tell people to love your neighbour or to love God but if you don't feel love, how can you do it?</a> 00:05:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h05m57s">Because they don't concern the whole body.</a> 00:05:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h06m01s">When Christians walk into church, they leave their body at the door!</a> 00:06:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h06m06s">And is it different in the Far East?</a> 00:06:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h06m09s">It's different.</a> 00:06:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h06m10s">Because in any of the Oriental ways, such as Buddhism or Hinduism, there goes along with it what is called in Sanskrit a Sadhana.</a> 00:06:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h06m20s">It means a practice.</a> 00:06:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h06m23s">And the object of the practice is curious.</a> 00:06:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h06m27s">It is to stop the flow of words inside your head. To come to a complete understanding so that you may be able to see reality as it is as distinct from reality as it is described.</a> 00:06:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h07m04s">I don't make any differentiation between the mind and the body and I don't even have, I don't even look at my body...</a> 00:07:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h07m11s">...at what has traditionally been understood as 'body', because the old idea of 'body' is that it's a vehicle that you go around in, like a chauffeur in a car...</a> 00:07:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h07m23s">... and that is not my idea. This is not body; this is a pattern which is being played by the energy of the universe.</a> 00:07:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h07m37s">I don't know whether it's physical, I don't know whether it's spiritual; I know it's impermanent like music is impermanent.</a> 00:07:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h07m44s">So...</a> 00:07:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h07m46s">My ideal of life...</a> 00:07:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h07m50s">...is...</a> 00:07:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h07m53s">...that being human being binds the spiritual to the senses; brings together the mystical and the material.</a> 00:07:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h08m05s">And therefore, I, on the one hand, am extremely fascinated with all questions of religious mysticism, of yoga, of Zen Buddhism, of Taoist practice and all that kind of thing.</a> 00:08:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h08m18s">On the other hand, I'm a sensualist. I like good food, I love to cook; I delight in being with women and I have absolutely no shame about this at all.</a> 00:08:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h09m19s">I'm very preoccupied with a quality of life because, you see, Americans, by and large, have a reputation for being materialists.</a> 00:09:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h09m28s">In my definition, a materialist is a person who loves material.</a> 00:09:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h09m35s">And Americans are not materialists because they don't like material, they hate it, and they're trying to convert it as fast as possible into junk.</a> 00:09:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h09m45s">And we feel that material is in every direction ... <em>unclear</em></a> 00:09:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h09m49s">Americans are all Christian scientists.</a> 00:09:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h09m52s">They don't believe in material; they want to abolish it and make the world as theoretical as possible.</a> 00:09:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h09m59s">'Why do we no longer know how to live?'</a> 00:09:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m05s">You are the real materialist because you love nature, you like things.</a> 00:10:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m10s">Yes, and I think that I love to cook.</a> 00:10:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m13s">Why do you always insist on cooking?</a> 00:10:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m15s">Because it's one of the most fundamental things in the world. Farming is first, obviously, or hunting then farming, then comes cooking.</a> 00:10:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m23s">And although I'm an intellectual and I work with my brain, I'm Brahman; the one thing I could do if all my intellectual world suddenly fell apart...</a> 00:10:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m31s">I would still be able to do something and that would be to cook for everybody.</a> 00:10:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m34s">Should we call you the Kitchen Philosopher?</a> 00:10:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m36s">Yes!</a> 00:10:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dpmF_6Aw_I#t=00h10m43s">Cooking is a religious rite because you have to reverence and love what ingredients you use. A Chinese philosopher, Linji Yixuan, said &quot;A fish that has died for you that has not been cooked well, has died in vain&quot;.</a> 00:10:43</p>
