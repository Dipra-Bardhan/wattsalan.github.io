<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m00s">What do you want? What makes you itch? What kind of situation do you like?</a> 00:00:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m10s">Let's assume, I do this often in career guidance for students, and they come to me and say: Well, we're out of college and have no idea what we want to do.</a> 00:00:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m22s">So I always ask this question, what do you want to do if the money is no object? How do you really enjoy spending your life?</a> 00:00:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m34s">Well, it's amazing as a result of our kind of educational system, crowds of students say Well, we want to be painters and would like to have poets and would like to have a book, but as everyone knows you can not earn any money that way.</a> 00:00:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m47s">Or someone else says well, I would like to live life outside the doors and riding. I said you want to teach in riding school? Let's go through with her. what do you want to do?</a> 00:00:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h00m58s">When we finally get to something, the individual who says he really wants to do, I'll tell him: you can do it and forget the money, because,</a> 00:00:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m11s">If you say that getting money is the most important thing, you will spend your life wasting your time completely.</a> 00:01:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m21s">You have to do things that you do not like doing in order to live, that is to go on doing things you do not like doing, which is stupid.</a> 00:01:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m30s">Better for a short life filled with what you want to do than a long life spent in a miserable way.</a> 00:01:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m37s">After all, if you really like what you do, no matter what it is, you can run in the end - you can eventually become a master of it.</a> 00:01:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m48s">It's the only way to become a master of something, to be really with it. Then you'll be able to get a good fee for whatever. So do not worry too much.</a> 00:01:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h01m58s">This everyone - is someone interested in everything, anything you can be interested in, others will find you will.</a> 00:01:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h02m05s">But it is totally stupid to spend your time doing things you do not like, in order to keep spending things you do not like, do those things you do not like and teach our kids to walk on the same path.</a> 00:02:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h02m18s">See what we are doing, is that we are bringing up children and teaching them to live the same kind of life that we live.</a> 00:02:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h02m25s">Perhaps they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by raising their children to bring their children to do the same thing, so whoever is going to eat everything, vomiting never happened there.</a> 00:02:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFUDVpFwFQ#t=00h02m38s">Thus, therefore, it is very important to consider the matter, what do I crave?</a> 00:02:38</p>
