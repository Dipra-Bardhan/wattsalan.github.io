<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m06s">In our fourth session this morning,</a> 00:00:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m10s">I was</a> 00:00:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m12s">trying to put across two principle ideas,</a> 00:00:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m17s">one of which</a> 00:00:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m19s">is that since</a> 00:00:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m21s">the idea of 'thusness'</a> 00:00:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m25s">is not a way</a> 00:00:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m28s">of putting down the nature of things.</a> 00:00:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m32s">That is to say, it's not a form of 'nothing-but-ery.'</a> 00:00:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m36s">(laughs)</a> 00:00:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m38s">There's certain things to be considered about it.</a> 00:00:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m43s">One is</a> 00:00:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m45s">that</a> 00:00:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m48s">there is what we call consciousness</a> 00:00:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m51s">involved in the nature of thusness.</a> 00:00:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h00m56s">Thusness is transparent and reverberating.</a> 00:00:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m01s">And the other was that within this domain, there is room</a> 00:01:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m06s">for an enormous number of value games.</a> 00:01:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m11s">But you must remember that value games</a> 00:01:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m14s">are games.</a> 00:01:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m17s">Now, let me just review those two points slightly,</a> 00:01:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m19s">because they're tremendously important.</a> 00:01:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m22s">First of all,</a> 00:01:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m24s">we've got into the habit</a> 00:01:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m26s">of thinking of the world</a> 00:01:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m29s">as a</a> 00:01:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m33s">physical continuum which is not really a continuum; which is divided</a> 00:01:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m38s">into the inert things and the ert things.</a> 00:01:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m42s">Into the conscious and the unconscious; the living and the dead;</a> 00:01:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m45s">the organic and the inorganic.</a> 00:01:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m48s">And the mythology of the 19th century</a> 00:01:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m51s">was to make it a case that everything was really inorganic.</a> 00:01:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m55s">You see?</a> 00:01:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h01m59s">And that consciousness</a> 00:01:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m01s">is something actually purely mineral and metallic,</a> 00:02:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m05s">only</a> 00:02:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m07s">it's so complicated</a> 00:02:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m10s">and so -- it's got all kinds of liquid and gooey things in it.</a> 00:02:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m15s">But they're basically minerals.</a> 00:02:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m18s">And they're basically machinery.</a> 00:02:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m20s">And it's all like that, you see?</a> 00:02:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m24s">And I say the objection to that point of view is simply</a> 00:02:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m28s">that</a> 00:02:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m30s">it's a way of looking down your nose at things.</a> 00:02:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m33s">In fact, it's an objection.</a> 00:02:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m35s">The objection to it <em>is</em> that it's an objection.</a> 00:02:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m40s">We won't go into such embarrassing questions as who objects.</a> 00:02:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m44s">but, the thing is, that it's --</a> 00:02:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m47s">when you construe the whole universe in an objectionable way,</a> 00:02:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m53s">a person who does this is really saying,</a> 00:02:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m57s">&quot;I want to be miserable.&quot;</a> 00:02:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h02m59s">Now, you're perfectly entitled to be miserable.</a> 00:02:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m02s">Or &quot;I want to be realistic, and miserable in that sense.&quot;</a> 00:03:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m04s">And that's perfectly okay, if that's the way you want to be.</a> 00:03:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m09s">But he has absolutely no right whatsoever</a> 00:03:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m13s">to say that his point of view is more valid</a> 00:03:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m16s">than our's, when we say the opposite.</a> 00:03:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m20s">That actually,</a> 00:03:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m23s">the universe is a continuum</a> 00:03:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m26s">of whatever it is -- thusness,</a> 00:03:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m31s">and that there's a spectrum</a> 00:03:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m33s">in which there are the very conscious things</a> 00:03:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m35s">and the only slightly conscious things.</a> 00:03:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m38s">But all of it is conscious.</a> 00:03:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m42s">And so that when you ring a bell,</a> 00:03:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m45s">and ears get this as 'ting,'</a> 00:03:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m49s">the bell itself gets it as a state of vibration.</a> 00:03:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m52s">Which is a very simple form of consciousness, but there it is.</a> 00:03:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m57s">So you don't have to explain,</a> 00:03:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h03m59s">you don't have to invent a ghastly problem,</a> 00:03:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m01s">which is, how did anything conscious ever get into this mechanism?</a> 00:04:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m07s">The -- it's a simpler thing that it always was there,</a> 00:04:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m11s">everything is conscious,</a> 00:04:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m13s">but conscious in</a> 00:04:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m15s">very many differing degrees.</a> 00:04:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m19s">I don't really know whether that's a simpler explanation than another</a> 00:04:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m23s">I mean, somebody could, I suppose, scratch their heads awhile and say,</a> 00:04:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m28s">&quot;How do you get from one degree to another?&quot;</a> 00:04:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m32s">See, they want to know how you get from the unconscious rock</a> 00:04:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m35s">to the conscious living being.</a> 00:04:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m40s">And I say, that's no problem.</a> 00:04:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m42s">They're just different degrees of the same thing.</a> 00:04:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m46s">But he says, &quot;How do you get from one degree to another?&quot;</a> 00:04:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m50s">And has he re-created all over again the same problem we started with?</a> 00:04:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m55s">Maybe he has.</a> 00:04:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h04m58s">But if he has,</a> 00:04:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m00s">you can see a new</a> 00:05:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m03s">line on the thing.</a> 00:05:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m05s">That this man's function</a> 00:05:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m08s">is to create problems.</a> 00:05:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m11s">Is to make interesting difficulties.</a> 00:05:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m13s">He's like a person who makes up the puzzle -- the crossword puzzle every day for the newspaper.</a> 00:05:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m19s">There's a man just setting difficulties for you.</a> 00:05:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m23s">And you love to get over them.</a> 00:05:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m26s">Or else, it doesn't interest you, because you</a> 00:05:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m28s">are playing a game, &quot;my game's more interesting than your's.&quot;</a> 00:05:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m34s">But nevertheless,</a> 00:05:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m38s">for some reason or other,</a> 00:05:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m41s">the idea of a spectrum</a> 00:05:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m43s">of a</a> 00:05:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m45s">somewhat more or somewhat less of the same thing</a> 00:05:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m49s">seems to make a great deal of sense. It seems more plausible</a> 00:05:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m53s">than the idea of having to have two completely different substances,</a> 00:05:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h05m57s">stuff called 'matter,' and a stuff called 'spirit,'</a> 00:05:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m00s">or 'mind,' or something like that.</a> 00:06:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m02s">And try and see how they work upon one another.</a> 00:06:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m06s">If you see --</a> 00:06:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m08s">in other words, let's take the beautiful</a> 00:06:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m11s">image of the fern.</a> 00:06:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m14s">First of all,</a> 00:06:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m16s">a stalk.</a> 00:06:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m17s">Just a thing like that.</a> 00:06:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m21s">And then,</a> 00:06:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m23s">more of them, but coming out of the sides.</a> 00:06:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m27s">And then, out of the sides of those, more stalks out of the sides of those. You see?</a> 00:06:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m33s">And then out of the sides of all those little ones,</a> 00:06:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m35s">come 'chit chit chit chit chit chit chit chit chit,'</a> 00:06:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m38s">little ones, too. See?</a> 00:06:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m40s">And you say, &quot;Well, look at that, it's getting very spiky, isn't it?&quot;</a> 00:06:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m44s">Full of spines.</a> 00:06:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m47s">And then, gradually, right on the edge of the spines is more, go</a> 00:06:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m49s">(softly) 'chichichichichichi'</a> 00:06:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m53s">until they're all going like this way, more and more and more and more,</a> 00:06:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h06m56s">until it becomes soft and hairy. See?</a> 00:06:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m00s">And suddely you've got</a> 00:07:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m02s">what you'd call a vegetable.</a> 00:07:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m06s">If you look at the watch,</a> 00:07:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m10s">some people have extremely tick-tock watches,</a> 00:07:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m12s">that is to say, they just have the hours marked with spots.</a> 00:07:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m17s">There are even more simple watches than that.</a> 00:07:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m19s">I've seen watches that simply have three -- four spots on them. Twelve and six,</a> 00:07:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m23s">nine and three.</a> 00:07:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m26s">But on the other extreme, you can buy very expensive watches</a> 00:07:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m30s">that have stopwatches on them</a> 00:07:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m33s">and things that tell you the date</a> 00:07:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m36s">and tachometers</a> 00:07:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m37s">and all kinds of involved things</a> 00:07:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m40s">and this watch's calibrations will be getting more and more and more complicated all the way around.</a> 00:07:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m46s">And begins to look like a flower.</a> 00:07:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m49s">You see? It begins to look --</a> 00:07:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m51s">what started out looking like kind of a metallic object</a> 00:07:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m54s">ends up looking like a</a> 00:07:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m56s">vegetable.</a> 00:07:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h07m58s">Or some kind of wonderful</a> 00:07:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m00s">growing, alive thing.</a> 00:08:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m03s">Beyond some mysterious point of complexity,</a> 00:08:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m06s">it seems to become alive.</a> 00:08:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m09s">So, this is what I mean by the spectrum</a> 00:08:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m16s">that -- of the various</a> 00:08:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m19s">just -- let's say games,</a> 00:08:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m21s">that are going on.</a> 00:08:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m24s">The very, very</a> 00:08:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m25s">'fuumm, fuumm, fuumm, fuumm' at one end,</a> 00:08:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m31s">and at the other end,</a> 00:08:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m33s">all kinds of complicate mechanical</a> 00:08:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m37s">metric motions. Rhythmic motions.</a> 00:08:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m40s">That are so</a> 00:08:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m45s">difficult</a> 00:08:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m47s">to reduce to anything so simple as 'chuumm, chuumm,'</a> 00:08:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m51s">and we say they're alive.</a> 00:08:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m54s">Whereas the things at the other end that are very, very simple,</a> 00:08:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h08m56s">like that, you see. We say, they are relatively inert.</a> 00:08:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m03s">But whether you say</a> 00:09:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m05s">that the inert</a> 00:09:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m07s">is merely less alive,</a> 00:09:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m10s">or whether you say that the alive</a> 00:09:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m12s">is merely the maximum complexity of the inert,</a> 00:09:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m16s">all depends on whether you want to say 'yes' to the world,</a> 00:09:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m19s">or whether you want to say 'no.'</a> 00:09:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m24s">So it is, as it were, a 'yes' saying</a> 00:09:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m29s">that makes everything seem alive.</a> 00:09:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m33s">And 'no' saying that makes everything seem dead.</a> 00:09:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m41s">And</a> 00:09:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m44s">when you say 'no,'</a> 00:09:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m47s">and you make it all seem dead,</a> 00:09:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m50s">what happens?</a> 00:09:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m54s">You experience a very extreme form</a> 00:09:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m57s">of differentiation</a> 00:09:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h09m59s">between yourself on the one hand,</a> 00:09:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m02s">and everything that you experience on the other.</a> 00:10:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m06s">Because if you want to put this world down,</a> 00:10:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m09s">and say, &quot;It's all just a bunch of junk,&quot;</a> 00:10:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m13s">You can't do that</a> 00:10:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m15s">without isolating yourself from it.</a> 00:10:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m19s">You've got to stand aside and be a completely independent observer, because</a> 00:10:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m24s">if you say, &quot;Therefore, I, too, am just a lot of junk,&quot;</a> 00:10:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m30s">&quot;And therefore, this statement that I am making is just a lot of junk,&quot;</a> 00:10:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m34s">then, obviously, you can't expect anybody</a> 00:10:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m36s">to lay very much credence upon it.</a> 00:10:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m40s">But on the other hand, when you say,</a> 00:10:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m43s">&quot;Well, good gracious, this whole thing is something, isn't it?&quot;</a> 00:10:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m48s">Then you put yourself into it.</a> 00:10:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m50s">You don't stand aside from it any longer. You admit</a> 00:10:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m53s">that you, too, are part of the whole thing.</a> 00:10:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m55s">That your ego, your self,</a> 00:10:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h10m57s">is so inextricably involved</a> 00:10:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m00s">with everything that you experience,</a> 00:11:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m02s">that there really ultimately isn't any difference</a> 00:11:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m05s">between the kind of thing that's going on</a> 00:11:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m08s">and you.</a> 00:11:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m12s">Let me -- then, then you see,</a> 00:11:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m16s">you've got a total system.</a> 00:11:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m19s">You are one with it, you're not standing aside from it.</a> 00:11:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m24s">But to make that clear, I just have to go into something that is puzzling for us</a> 00:11:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m28s">whose thinking is based on sentence structure</a> 00:11:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m31s">and of us --</a> 00:11:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m33s">a kind of grammar that has</a> 00:11:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m36s">subject, verb, and predicate,</a> 00:11:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m37s">and a kind of mythology</a> 00:11:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m40s">wherein we think of consciousness,</a> 00:11:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m43s">and being aware, by analogy with photography</a> 00:11:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m46s">and with mirrors reflecting images.</a> 00:11:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m52s">If you can understand</a> 00:11:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m55s">that</a> 00:11:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h11m57s">what you are</a> 00:11:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h12m04s">is everything that you know.</a> 00:12:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h12m12s">There are, you see, a number -- there are infinitely many ways</a> 00:12:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h12m18s">of</a> 00:12:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h12m21s">-- oh, language ties us up. I was going to say, &quot;being conscious of what's going on.&quot;</a> 00:12:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h12m27s">Each one of us looks at the present scene</a> 00:12:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h12m29s">from a different point of view, but</a> 00:12:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h12m32s">let me say -- look at it like this.</a> 00:12:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h12m35s">Supposing I say instead: Each one of us is a different point of view with respect to the situation.</a> 00:12:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m00s">You see, we can say...</a> 00:13:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m06s">here's the situation.</a> 00:13:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m08s">(draws on chalkboard)</a> 00:13:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m11s">And each one of us --</a> 00:13:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m13s">here's an eye, see?</a> 00:13:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m15s">Looks at it</a> 00:13:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m17s">from a different point of view.</a> 00:13:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m24s">And so,</a> 00:13:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m25s">we go into it, like this.</a> 00:13:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m31s">Now that's a very disintegrated picture.</a> 00:13:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m35s">What is the connection between this and this?</a> 00:13:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m38s">What's behind this?</a> 00:13:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m44s">And where does all that come from? What's its relation to this; the situation?</a> 00:13:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m48s">No, we are part of the situation.</a> 00:13:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m51s">You can't deny that.</a> 00:13:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m52s">So, you see, the thing behind this</a> 00:13:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h13m58s">is - is this, you see?</a> 00:13:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m03s">See what I mean?</a> 00:14:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m04s">You are not out of it. Alright then, if that's the way it is,</a> 00:14:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m07s">we've got to draw a different diagram altogether.</a> 00:14:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m12s">Here's the situation again.</a> 00:14:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m15s">Now,</a> 00:14:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m17s">We talk about a point of view <em>towards</em> the situation.</a> 00:14:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m20s">But can't you see that the situation</a> 00:14:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m23s">grows out of itself, points of view?</a> 00:14:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m27s">Like this?</a> 00:14:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m31s">(drawing)</a> 00:14:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m36s">See? And then, here they are.</a> 00:14:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m43s">The little eyes in the end of it, you see, like a snail, but it's a big snail.</a> 00:14:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m46s">With many, many eyes. See?</a> 00:14:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m50s">So it looks at itself, like that.</a> 00:14:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m53s">Looks at itself through many eyes.</a> 00:14:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h14m57s">But, so, in other words, what each one calls</a> 00:14:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m02s">our self,</a> 00:15:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m04s">is a point of view taken</a> 00:15:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m06s">by, what each one of us calls, our experience.</a> 00:15:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m10s">You get that?</a> 00:15:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m13s">It isn't --</a> 00:15:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m14s">Experience, in other words, it doesn't mean, really</a> 00:15:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m19s">an <em>experience</em> and an <em>experiencer.</em></a> 00:15:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m22s">You don't need a thought,</a> 00:15:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m24s">and then to have a thought, you have to have a thinker,</a> 00:15:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m26s">or to have a thinker, then you can have a thought.</a> 00:15:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m34s">All I'm introducing you to, you see, is really a simplified language.</a> 00:15:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m40s">Do you feel a feeling?</a> 00:15:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m43s">Or is feeling a feeling the same thing as feeling?</a> 00:15:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m47s">It's easier, isn't it, to say &quot;feeling&quot; instead of &quot;feeling a feeling.&quot;</a> 00:15:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h15m54s">&quot;There was a faith healer of Deal, who said,</a> 00:15:54</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h16m14s">&quot;There was a young man who said, 'Though,' &quot;</a> 00:16:14</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h16m30s">This is what it -- so, when you see</a> 00:16:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h16m36s">that things,</a> 00:16:36</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h16m42s">are inseperable,</a> 00:16:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h16m45s">it isn't that the physical world is reflected in a mirror</a> 00:16:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h16m50s">but that it and consciousness are all one.</a> 00:16:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h16m54s">But that</a> 00:16:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h16m56s">consciousness</a> 00:16:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m02s">seems to be</a> 00:17:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m06s">something that is different from the world, and looks at it</a> 00:17:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m12s">because</a> 00:17:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m13s">it is done</a> 00:17:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m16s">focused, projected</a> 00:17:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m19s">in so many different ways,</a> 00:17:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m22s">and these are like the spikes coming out.</a> 00:17:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m25s">See? You remember my fern thing.</a> 00:17:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m29s">We can play ferns with this.</a> 00:17:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m33s">And we can start</a> 00:17:33</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m43s">Or take any one of these and start doing this, see?</a> 00:17:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m50s">Take one of these and start doing this.</a> 00:17:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m52s">See?</a> 00:17:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m53s">All points of view</a> 00:17:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m55s">going</a> 00:17:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h17m58s">out of the center.</a> 00:17:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m16s">So then,</a> 00:18:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m18s">remember</a> 00:18:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m21s">that what you are experiencing</a> 00:18:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m23s">-- you can remember it -- perhaps it's easier for some of you in this way.</a> 00:18:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m28s">What you are seeing out there, in front of you,</a> 00:18:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m33s">is actually a sensation inside your head.</a> 00:18:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m40s">All that you see</a> 00:18:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m42s">is a conversion of quanta</a> 00:18:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m45s">in the external world</a> 00:18:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m49s">into the form of your brain.</a> 00:18:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h18m56s">Your brain, in its term, being something in the external world.</a> 00:18:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m03s">Now then, when it's in your brain,</a> 00:19:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m08s">you say, &quot;Now I see it in terms of my brain.&quot;</a> 00:19:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m12s">Well, is there somebody standing back inside your brain,</a> 00:19:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m15s">you see, and looking at your brain and saying,</a> 00:19:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m18s">&quot;Well there it is, what a nice picture.&quot;</a> 00:19:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m22s">See, if you can get this, it's wonderful.</a> 00:19:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m24s">The centers of the optic nerves are right in the back of your head.</a> 00:19:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m29s">They're not just here. If they were just here,</a> 00:19:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m31s">you could imagine someone standing inside your head and looking at them.</a> 00:19:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m35s">But actually, they're right back there.</a> 00:19:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m37s">So what you are seeing in front of your eyes</a> 00:19:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m40s">is right back in here, where it's actually happening.</a> 00:19:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m44s">So you can stroke the view here</a> 00:19:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m48s">with your fingers, see?</a> 00:19:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m51s">Now, there isn't somebody in the middle who's turned around,</a> 00:19:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m55s">looking at the back of your head,</a> 00:19:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m56s">like the people in Plato's cave,</a> 00:19:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h19m59s">to see what's out in front.</a> 00:19:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m02s">The point is that, the sensation of your self</a> 00:20:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m07s">and the sensation of other people is the same thing.</a> 00:20:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m12s">And that's mutual between all of us, you see?</a> 00:20:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m15s">We all are our view of other people and other things.</a> 00:20:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m23s">Views of views.</a> 00:20:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m26s">Views of viewings.</a> 00:20:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m31s">And so,</a> 00:20:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m41s">You don't have to introduce the problem</a> 00:20:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m49s">of how the knower knows.</a> 00:20:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m54s">How does the world make an impact</a> 00:20:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h20m58s">on the knowing subject?</a> 00:20:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m00s">So that it can be aware of,</a> 00:21:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m04s">be conscious of, everything else.</a> 00:21:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m11s">There isn't that kind of</a> 00:21:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m13s">mirror or camera process going on.</a> 00:21:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m16s">That's the important thing to understand, because</a> 00:21:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m18s">everybody's thought is so powerfully influenced</a> 00:21:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m21s">by the metaphors that he uses,</a> 00:21:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m23s">and the metaphors for knowing and for consciousness,</a> 00:21:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m26s">mirrors, cameras, etc etc</a> 00:21:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m28s">can be extraordinarily...</a> 00:21:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m33s">introducing unnecessary complications.</a> 00:21:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m38s">Simply see that</a> 00:21:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m44s">what you are aware of,</a> 00:21:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m48s">in terms of external sensory experiences,</a> 00:21:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m52s">in terms of so-called internal feelings, internal thoughts,</a> 00:21:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h21m56s">that is what you are.</a> 00:21:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m01s">Krishnamurti puts it so beautifully when he tries to show</a> 00:22:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m04s">that behind the stream of thoughts, there isn't a thinker.</a> 00:22:04</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m29s">But actually,</a> 00:22:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m33s">there is simply the stream</a> 00:22:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m37s">of, what you could call, luminous experience.</a> 00:22:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m42s">And you can translate -- you can take away the word 'luminous'</a> 00:22:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m46s">and put the word 'conscious' in its place.</a> 00:22:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m53s">So, see it again:</a> 00:22:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m54s">Your heads, your nervous systems, your eyes, your senses, your bodies</a> 00:22:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h22m59s">not as something that encounters the external environment from outside.</a> 00:22:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m04s">You all <em>are</em> the external environment.</a> 00:23:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m08s">Rather, your heads and eyes and so on</a> 00:23:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m11s">are points, you see, put out by the environment.</a> 00:23:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m16s">As a whole, as a totality.</a> 00:23:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m20s">Through which it feels all around</a> 00:23:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m24s">like many sensitive hairs, like a sea urchin</a> 00:23:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m27s">with all those little spines coming out of it.</a> 00:23:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m29s">And each one of us is one.</a> 00:23:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m40s">Well now,</a> 00:23:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m42s">there is a final matter to be considered.</a> 00:23:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h23m55s">I have given some seminars on far-Eastern aesthetics.</a> 00:23:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m01s">And some of you may have attended some of them.</a> 00:24:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m09s">When we talk about Chinese art,</a> 00:24:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m12s">as compared, say, with...</a> 00:24:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m18s">Mexican art, or...</a> 00:24:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m23s">Cambodian art,</a> 00:24:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m26s">we say it's naturalistic.</a> 00:24:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m33s">On the other hand, these other art forms are highly stylized.</a> 00:24:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m49s">What do we mean</a> 00:24:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m51s">when we say an art form is more natural than another one?</a> 00:24:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m56s">It's rather difficult to say, isn't it?</a> 00:24:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h24m58s">Because you're trying to say that</a> 00:24:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m04s">somehow or other,</a> 00:25:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m10s">things that look</a> 00:25:10</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m20s">are not as natural</a> 00:25:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m23s">as things that look like this.</a> 00:25:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m30s">What do you mean by that?</a> 00:25:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m38s">What is natural</a> 00:25:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m40s">somehow strikes us as being a little bit more asymmetrical.</a> 00:25:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m44s">Little bit more wiggly</a> 00:25:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m46s">than what we call artificial.</a> 00:25:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m52s">Well, ever looked at</a> 00:25:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m56s">sugar crystals under a microscope?</a> 00:25:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h25m58s">Beautiful cubes.</a> 00:25:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m01s">What about iron pyrites?</a> 00:26:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m04s">All kinds of things in the crystal world.</a> 00:26:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m07s">They look very formal,</a> 00:26:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m10s">very stylized, very artificial.</a> 00:26:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m14s">Go to the Charles Darwin Hall at the Museum of Natural History</a> 00:26:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m19s">and take a look at the glass models of radiolaria.</a> 00:26:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m25s">You had never seen anything so artificial.</a> 00:26:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m28s">But my goodness, what a wile of artificiality!</a> 00:26:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m31s">It's like looking at a master jeweler.</a> 00:26:31</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m45s">But this is the magic of nature.</a> 00:26:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m49s">Really, go there.</a> 00:26:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m50s">If it's open now. They were renewing it.</a> 00:26:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m52s">But it is the most beautiful exhibition in New York.</a> 00:26:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h26m57s">Makes all the painting look pretty silly.</a> 00:26:57</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m15s">So, you see, the point is</a> 00:27:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m18s">fundamentally, there is no such thing</a> 00:27:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m21s">as an artificial work.</a> 00:27:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m25s">All that happens is nature.</a> 00:27:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m27s">All that happens is</a> 00:27:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m31s">however apparently artificial,</a> 00:27:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m33s">still</a> 00:27:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m35s">within the one domain.</a> 00:27:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m38s">Once again, you see, we get a continuum.</a> 00:27:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m41s">Everything in this continuum is nature.</a> 00:27:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m45s">Just like everything in a continuum is consciousness.</a> 00:27:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m47s">But at one end, it's apparently less natural</a> 00:27:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m51s">than at the other.</a> 00:27:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m53s">It all is natural.</a> 00:27:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h27m55s">But what is less natural</a> 00:27:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m00s">isn't necessarily</a> 00:28:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m02s">for that reason,</a> 00:28:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m05s">boring,</a> 00:28:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m06s">lacking in form; lacking in excitement.</a> 00:28:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m11s">Because beyond the radiolaria, the diatom, is...</a> 00:28:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m22s">the works of art of mankind.</a> 00:28:22</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m26s">the work of the computer.</a> 00:28:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m30s">All in the direction, the dimension, of the artificial.</a> 00:28:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m34s">But you never reach the purely artificial.</a> 00:28:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m36s">You never, never get outside the domain of nature.</a> 00:28:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m42s">So</a> 00:28:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h28m45s">from one point of view then,</a> 00:28:45</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h29m03s">you can manifest the Dao</a> 00:29:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h29m07s">and be in accord with it, and be</a> 00:29:07</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h30m42s">I'm going to want to show you,</a> 00:30:42</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h31m02s">There is a saying in</a> 00:31:02</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h31m46s">The mountain gets the mountain.</a> 00:31:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h31m49s">And the water</a> 00:31:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h31m53s">gets the water.</a> 00:31:53</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m01s">Now, mountain water, the two characters together,</a> 00:32:01</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m09s">Now, when does a mountain get the mountain</a> 00:32:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m11s">and the water gets the water?</a> 00:32:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m14s">The answer is that the mountain gets the mountain</a> 00:32:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m16s">when a particular mountain</a> 00:32:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m19s">looks just like a mountain.</a> 00:32:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m22s">And when the water looks just like water.</a> 00:32:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m25s">And we can say of this -- say of a person,</a> 00:32:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m28s">this man is so much of a man.</a> 00:32:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m30s">This woman is so much of a woman.</a> 00:32:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m32s">So, the man gets the man; the woman gets the woman.</a> 00:32:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m36s">And</a> 00:32:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m38s">Well, you know, you can do that too, you see?</a> 00:32:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m41s">A man... (drawing)</a> 00:32:41</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m53s">So</a> 00:32:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h32m58s">how are we going to do that?</a> 00:32:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m00s">Every man is a man,</a> 00:33:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m02s">every woman is a woman,</a> 00:33:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m03s">every mountain, after all, is a mountain.</a> 00:33:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m05s">But some mountains are more like mountains than others.</a> 00:33:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m11s">G. K. Chesterton once put it in a kind of satirical way:</a> 00:33:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m15s">&quot;All religions are really the same religion, especially Buddhism.&quot;</a> 00:33:15</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m27s">He was trying to poke fun at people who say</a> 00:33:27</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m32s">But what a wise word, you see, he had there.</a> 00:33:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m37s">So now, it comes to this question of</a> 00:33:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m40s">how do we show something</a> 00:33:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m41s">as being <em>more</em> of the nature of thusness?</a> 00:33:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m44s">Or especially of the nature of thusness?</a> 00:33:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m46s">The same question as, how do we show something as being</a> 00:33:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m50s">more natural than something else?</a> 00:33:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m54s">Now this lies, you see -- this is the basic problem</a> 00:33:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h33m57s">of aesthetics in the Far East.</a> 00:33:57</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h34m10s">can be constructed</a> 00:34:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h34m12s">to look more like a work of nature</a> 00:34:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h34m15s">than other houses.</a> 00:34:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h34m18s">'Cause this is part of the real fun of going to</a> 00:34:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h34m22s">a place like Kyoto.</a> 00:34:22</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h34m26s">they've been tremendously aware of this problem.</a> 00:34:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h34m29s">Now you can go, on the one hand,</a> 00:34:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h34m33s">to the Heian Shrine.</a> 00:34:33</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m02s">And then you go across to a place</a> 00:36:02</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m27s">a place that would look as much as possible</a> 00:36:27</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m37s">But now, how could he do that?</a> 00:36:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m41s">He could've found a place</a> 00:36:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m42s">which hadn't happened on purpose at all.</a> 00:36:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m46s">He could've taken, simply, the hillside.</a> 00:36:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m49s">And sat down there.</a> 00:36:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m52s">And not done a thing.</a> 00:36:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m54s">But somehow, adapt himself to the changing temperature</a> 00:36:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h36m57s">and become nature.</a> 00:36:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m02s">But it's not the nature of a man to do that.</a> 00:37:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m06s">He needs clothes because he didn't grow fur.</a> 00:37:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m09s">And he needs a house, and he needs to eat, and so on.</a> 00:37:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m12s">And so</a> 00:37:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m13s">a man does it in a different way.</a> 00:37:13</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m46s">Because the man enjoyed the problem</a> 00:37:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m51s">of &quot;how natural can I make it?&quot;</a> 00:37:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m54s">He really knocked himself out.</a> 00:37:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m56s">Now, you see, look here.</a> 00:37:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m57s">Here's the problem of 'how natural can I make it.'</a> 00:37:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h37m59s">(rustling paper)</a> 00:37:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m03s">I want to arrange</a> 00:38:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m05s">in this area</a> 00:38:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m10s">some rocks.</a> 00:38:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m11s">See, this is a big expanse of sand.</a> 00:38:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m15s">And I want to put them so that they don't look as if</a> 00:38:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m18s">they had arrived there artificially.</a> 00:38:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m22s">Now, what am I going to do?</a> 00:38:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m23s">Obviously, if I do this, I put a rock here --</a> 00:38:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m27s">and a rock here</a> 00:38:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m30s">and a rock there.</a> 00:38:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m32s">(drawing)</a> 00:38:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m35s">Well, somebody will say, one-two-three.</a> 00:38:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m38s">You know, it looks as if somebody laid them there!</a> 00:38:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m42s">And what you wanted was a situation where it</a> 00:38:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m45s">it didn't look as if it had been laid out like that.</a> 00:38:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m49s">So we begin again.</a> 00:38:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m52s">So we put rock one</a> 00:38:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h38m56s">rock two...</a> 00:38:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m04s">and rock three.</a> 00:39:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m12s">Now are we going to accuse anybody of anything?</a> 00:39:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m14s">Yes, maybe we are.</a> 00:39:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m17s">We're going to say, &quot;Now wait a minute,&quot;</a> 00:39:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m18s">&quot;you couldn't get away from it so far.&quot;</a> 00:39:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m21s">&quot;You put these two together in alignment, close,</a> 00:39:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m25s">and then you thought,</a> 00:39:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m27s">'Well, then, the other one should be further away from it.'</a> 00:39:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m29s">'It should be somewhere like that.' &quot; See?</a> 00:39:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m33s">But then you would say, &quot;No,&quot;</a> 00:39:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m36s">&quot;they're all pointing the same direction.</a> 00:39:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m38s">Reverse this one, and put it that way.&quot;</a> 00:39:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m42s">See, it still looks a little artificial.</a> 00:39:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m46s">It always looks artificial</a> 00:39:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m48s">so long as we can trace the thinking of the artist.</a> 00:39:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m52s">But when we can't trace the thinking of the artist --</a> 00:39:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m57s">(rustling paper)</a> 00:39:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h39m59s">Look, we'll divide the thing in two.</a> 00:39:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m03s">We're still using the same pieces.</a> 00:40:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m19s">Well, they might've been thrown there.</a> 00:40:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m22s">But that's not good enough.</a> 00:40:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m25s">What we want is the point</a> 00:40:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m26s">where we can trace his thinking to the point</a> 00:40:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m28s">where it is only just vanished.</a> 00:40:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m36s">We are <em>just</em> going to keep pace with it.</a> 00:40:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m40s">And we are saying this, it's not quite as if it had been thrown down there.</a> 00:40:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m45s">Something a little better than if it had been thrown down there.</a> 00:40:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m51s">And</a> 00:40:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h40m54s">that is the most difficult thing in the world for an artist to achieve.</a> 00:40:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m00s">I mean...</a> 00:41:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m15s">There's a trick to that.</a> 00:41:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m18s">In other words, they've slowly rotated.</a> 00:41:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m21s">But at distances which don't suggest</a> 00:41:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m29s">orderly, numbered arrangement.</a> 00:41:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m34s">Some of you may immediately see that trick that I use.</a> 00:41:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m38s">Some of you may not see it.</a> 00:41:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m42s">But the point is,</a> 00:41:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m45s">that the artist gets to the situation</a> 00:41:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m47s">with relation to his beholders</a> 00:41:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m50s">where he has a trick just beyond what they see</a> 00:41:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h41m57s">and almost just beyond what he knows.</a> 00:41:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m01s">Do you see? It just reaches a critical point.</a> 00:42:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m07s">And so, it is <em>so</em> close to chaos</a> 00:42:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m12s">and yet,</a> 00:42:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m14s">so close to being order</a> 00:42:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m16s">that it's the point where the one turns into the other.</a> 00:42:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m21s">Because here again, you got a continuum.</a> 00:42:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m23s">You got chaos way out here, (drawing)</a> 00:42:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m25s">you've got order way over here.</a> 00:42:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m28s">And you can approach this one</a> 00:42:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m32s">or approach this one,</a> 00:42:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m37s">but at a certain moment,</a> 00:42:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m40s">when you approach chaos</a> 00:42:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-IRvwI81a4#t=00h42m42s">but it's still really order,</a> 00:42:42</p>
<p>[then you get a garden like Ry</p>
