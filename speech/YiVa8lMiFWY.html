<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m07s">which you're not gonna be thinking about with the extreme - even at maximum</a> 00:26:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m08s">with the extreme - even at maximum</a> 00:26:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m08s">with the extreme - even at maximum volume however there's not much clarity</a> 00:26:08</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m12s">there's not much else going on kind of</a> 00:26:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m12s">there's not much else going on kind of compressed sound so it's a different</a> 00:26:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m14s">compressed sound so it's a different</a> 00:26:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m14s">compressed sound so it's a different sound I just think it's more satisfying</a> 00:26:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m15s">sound I just think it's more satisfying</a> 00:26:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m15s">sound I just think it's more satisfying at maximum volumes with extreme so I</a> 00:26:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m17s">at maximum volumes with extreme so I</a> 00:26:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m17s">at maximum volumes with extreme so I just put it in there because a people</a> 00:26:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m20s">just put it in there because a people</a> 00:26:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m20s">just put it in there because a people with a handle on it and B because it's</a> 00:26:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m22s">with a handle on it and B because it's</a> 00:26:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m22s">with a handle on it and B because it's about the same price as going to one</a> 00:26:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m23s">about the same price as going to one</a> 00:26:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m23s">about the same price as going to one point one so yeah after all that the</a> 00:26:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m27s">point one so yeah after all that the</a> 00:26:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVa8lMiFWY#t=00h26m27s">point one so yeah after all that the basic conclusion is it makes a big</a> 00:26:27</p>
