<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m00s">If you ready to wake up, you gonna wake up</a> 00:00:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m04s">and if you're not ready you're gonna stay pretending that you're just a 'poor little me'.</a> 00:00:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m11s">And since you all here and engaged in this sort of inquiry and listening to this sort of lecture,</a> 00:00:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m17s">I assume that you're all on the process of waking up.</a> 00:00:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m21s">Or else you're teasing yourselves with some kind of flirtation with waking up</a> 00:00:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m31s">which you're not serious about.</a> 00:00:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m33s">But I assume maybe you are not serious, but sincere</a> 00:00:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m37s">that you are ready to wake up.</a> 00:00:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m41s">So then, when you're in the way of waking up, and finding out who you really are,</a> 00:00:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m46s">what you do is what the whole universe is doing at the place you call here and now.</a> 00:00:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h00m55s">You are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing.</a> 00:00:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m04s">The real you is not a puppet which life pushes around;</a> 00:01:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m10s">the real, deep down you is the whole universe.</a> 00:01:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m15s">So then, when you die,</a> 00:01:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m18s">you're not going to have to put up with everlasting non-existence,</a> 00:01:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m22s">because that's not an experience.</a> 00:01:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m25s">Lot of people are afraid that when they die,</a> 00:01:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m28s">they're gonna be locked up in a dark room forever,</a> 00:01:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m32s">and sort of undergo that.</a> 00:01:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m38s">But one of the most interesting things in the world - this is a yoga, this is a way of realization</a> 00:01:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m44s">try and imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up.</a> 00:01:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m51s">Think about that.</a> 00:01:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m53s">Children think about that.</a> 00:01:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m55s">It's one of the great wonders of life.</a> 00:01:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h01m57s">What will it be like to go to sleep and never wake up?</a> 00:01:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m02s">And if you think long enough about that, something will happen to you.</a> 00:02:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m06s">You will find out, among other things,</a> 00:02:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m10s">that it will pose the next question to you.</a> 00:02:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m14s">What was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep?</a> 00:02:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m18s">That was when you were born.</a> 00:02:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m24s">You see, you can't have an experience of nothing;</a> 00:02:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m27s">nature abhors a vacuum.</a> 00:02:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m29s">So after you're dead, the only thing that can happen is the same experience, or the same sort of experience when you were born.</a> 00:02:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m39s">In other words, we all know very well that after people die, other people are born.</a> 00:02:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m45s">And they're all you, only you can only experience one at a time.</a> 00:02:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m51s">Everybody is I, you all know you're you</a> 00:02:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h02m56s">and wheresoever beings exist throughout all galaxies, it doesn't make any difference.</a> 00:02:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h03m00s">You are all of them.</a> 00:03:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h03m02s">And when they come into being, that's you coming into being.</a> 00:03:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h03m05s">You know that very well,</a> 00:03:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h03m08s">only you don't have to remember the past in the same way you don't have to think about how you work your thyroid gland,</a> 00:03:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h03m17s">or whatever else it is in your organism.</a> 00:03:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h03m19s">You don't have to know how to shine the sun. You just do it, like you breath.</a> 00:03:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h03m26s">Doesn't it really astonish you that you are the fantastically complex thing,</a> 00:03:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRrCYPxD0I#t=00h03m33s">and that you're doing all of this and you never had any education in how to do it?</a> 00:03:33</p>
