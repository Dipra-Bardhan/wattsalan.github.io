<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h02m00s">Obviously no one can say because it isn't words</a> 00:02:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h02m05s">It is material. That's just an idea</a> 00:02:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h02m10s">It isn't spiritual. That's also an idea a symbol</a> 00:02:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h02m17s">Reality is this</a> 00:02:17</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h02m46s">Anybody whom you consider is not as spiritual psychological and so long as an Authority?</a> 00:02:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h02m54s">Has this authority because of your opinion that he has or she has?</a> 00:02:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m03s">How do you know?</a> 00:03:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m07s">If you say for example like a protestant fundamentalist</a> 00:03:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m12s">That you believe in the bible</a> 00:03:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m14s">But the Bible is inspired</a> 00:03:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m16s">All you may say is a more liberal kind of Christian that Jesus Christ is</a> 00:03:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m22s">The greatest being that ever lived on Earth</a> 00:03:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m27s">How do you know?</a> 00:03:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m30s">It's your opinion that that itself</a> 00:03:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m32s">Lots of people may have [knows] you so and you may be very impressed by those people that you bought it</a> 00:03:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m43s">and</a> 00:03:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m45s">so therefore if you say</a> 00:03:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m48s">Well, I would like to become like that. That's an expression of the way you are</a> 00:03:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h03m58s">You couldn't feel I would like to become like that like the authority like the christ</a> 00:03:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m05s">Except as an expression of the way you are now and the way you are now is the quaking [lift]</a> 00:04:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m10s">and</a> 00:04:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m12s">therefore your emulation your desire your</a> 00:04:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m17s">Idealism to become like Christ is merely one of the appetites is your quaking, mass</a> 00:04:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m27s">It's an expression in you as you are don't fool yourself</a> 00:04:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m32s">I'm trying to put you down</a> 00:04:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m34s">By talking about the quaking [wrath]</a> 00:04:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m37s">The quaking mess. Maybe in fact something very very natural</a> 00:04:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m41s">the way we are</a> 00:04:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m43s">the state of affairs</a> 00:04:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m45s">And we shouldn't be ashamed of it. I'm not ashamed. [I] told you are the tracting</a> 00:04:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h04m55s">But it is it ought not fool oneself about this</a> 00:04:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m04s">But there does doesn't seem to remain a problem about existence about being alive?</a> 00:05:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m14s">Now let's go into what is that problem as the sort of nitty gritty level?</a> 00:05:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m25s">Very basic in our thinking is that we does it say one must live</a> 00:05:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m33s">We need to survive</a> 00:05:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m35s">To go on we need therefore</a> 00:05:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m38s">money</a> 00:05:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m40s">For food for this that knee up, we must go on</a> 00:05:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m45s">And we know</a> 00:05:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m49s">That we're not going to get away with it for very long</a> 00:05:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m54s">but</a> 00:05:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h05m55s">After a certain number of years we're going to die lastly the thing is going to end the thing that we call I</a> 00:05:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m01s">is going to</a> 00:06:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m03s">Be as it is in sleep</a> 00:06:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m06s">deep sleep with no dreams</a> 00:06:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m10s">But that between now and that hand</a> 00:06:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m15s">There may be the most ghastly pain</a> 00:06:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m22s">Not only to have the pains the physical disease</a> 00:06:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m26s">Or being wounded or hurt</a> 00:06:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m29s">But the pains are worrying about our failure of responsibility to people who depend on</a> 00:06:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m38s">and</a> 00:06:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m40s">we</a> 00:06:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m41s">suffer other people suffering simply because we're sensitive and that imagination and participate in their patras when our adrenaline and our you'll</a> 00:06:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m49s">respond</a> 00:06:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h06m50s">Simply by imagination to the buttons of other people and what about that?</a> 00:06:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m00s">and so we can look at these problems and</a> 00:07:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m03s">Say now</a> 00:07:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m05s">quite obviously</a> 00:07:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m07s">All these problems cannot be solved in a physical way that is to say we do not expect</a> 00:07:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m15s">In our lifetime that medical skill will make us exempt from death</a> 00:07:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m22s">we do not seriously expect that human beings will all learn to be nice to each other and</a> 00:07:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m28s">[will] refrain from War and</a> 00:07:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m31s">horrors of that kind Racial prejudice, and so on we don't seriously expect</a> 00:07:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m39s">To find a method of being protected by taking some sort of drugs against all possible disease and pain</a> 00:07:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h07m50s">So therefore we say now maybe there's another way [around] maybe</a> 00:07:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m02s">that instead of solving these problems of the technical ee</a> 00:08:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m07s">we could solve them of the pSychological and spiritual level by so</a> 00:08:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m12s">Disciplining ourselves by those doing something about those</a> 00:08:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m16s">But we wouldn't be afraid of it anymore</a> 00:08:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m21s">And so in [accord] with that motivation we seek out</a> 00:08:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m27s">Spiritual teachers psychological teachers is that [in] the other?</a> 00:08:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m31s">Could we somehow be made over?</a> 00:08:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m34s">So that we don't</a> 00:08:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m39s">Worry about the quaking met by a spiritual discipline all over</a> 00:08:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m50s">and you see if you examine that</a> 00:08:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m54s">that this</a> 00:08:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h08m56s">Wanting to overcome the quaking mess and not have it anymore</a> 00:08:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m02s">That precisely is [the] quaking [math]</a> 00:09:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m10s">The thing that we object to about ourselves</a> 00:09:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m18s">Is precisely what we do about overcoming it in?</a> 00:09:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m23s">Other words the activity that we employ in overcoming. It is the mess that we objective</a> 00:09:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m30s">Do you see that?</a> 00:09:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m32s">and</a> 00:09:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m34s">It's very important to realize</a> 00:09:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m39s">Then if you do realize that you raise the question, then what can I do?</a> 00:09:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m51s">What can I do to transform the quaking mass?</a> 00:09:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h09m56s">Into the state of mind of the true mystic well if you are the quaking map there is obviously nothing you can do</a> 00:09:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h10m03s">To transform yourself into the state of mind which you [idealize] without being the true mystic surprise the Saint or whatever</a> 00:10:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h10m12s">so</a> 00:10:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h10m13s">You realize that?</a> 00:10:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h10m15s">Everything is funny that</a> 00:10:15</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h32m45s">This is the principle called in Japanese judith</a> 00:32:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h32m49s">meaning the gentle way</a> 00:32:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h32m51s">Go along with us. Go along with it. Go along</a> 00:32:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m01s">So therefore, this is the beginning of meditation</a> 00:33:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m05s">You don't know what you're supposed to do</a> 00:33:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m09s">What can you do? Well if you don't know what you're supposed to do?</a> 00:33:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m14s">You watch</a> 00:33:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m18s">You simply watch what's going on?</a> 00:33:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m24s">like say somebody plays music</a> 00:33:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m28s">you listen and you just follow those sounds and</a> 00:33:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m36s">Eventually you understand the point of the music</a> 00:33:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m40s">the point cannot be explained in words because music is not worse, but</a> 00:33:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m47s">[after] a while in listening to any music you will understand the point [ups]</a> 00:33:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h33m54s">And that point will [be] the music itself</a> 00:33:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m03s">So in exactly the same way</a> 00:34:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m07s">You can listen to all experiences because all experiences whatsoever are vibrations coming at you</a> 00:34:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m14s">Well there, you are these vibrations as a matter of fact if you could really feel out. What is happening?</a> 00:34:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m20s">what you are aware of as you others everything else is all the same it's a</a> 00:34:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m27s">Very very odd vibrations of all kinds and they're on different bands of spectrum</a> 00:34:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m33s">the sight vibrations emotion vibrations</a> 00:34:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m37s">Touch vibrations sound vibrations all these things adding together are woven</a> 00:34:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m44s">[if] all the different senses are woven and</a> 00:34:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m48s">You get a pattern in the weaving and that pattern is the picture of what you now feel?</a> 00:34:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m55s">this</a> 00:34:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h34m59s">I [think]</a> 00:34:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m03s">now</a> 00:35:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m05s">Instead of saying what should I do about it because who knows what to do about it?</a> 00:35:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m11s">To know what to do [about] this you would have to know everything</a> 00:35:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m15s">and if you don't</a> 00:35:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m17s">Then the only thing that is at [least] to begin with to begin with you can [do] is watch</a> 00:35:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m26s">Watch what's going on?</a> 00:35:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m29s">Watch not only what's going on on the [outside]</a> 00:35:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m32s">But also what's going on on the inside?</a> 00:35:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m35s">Treat your own thoughts</a> 00:35:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m37s">Their own reactions your own emotions about what's going on outside as if those</a> 00:35:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m43s">Inside reactions were also outside things</a> 00:35:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m50s">that you're just watching and</a> 00:35:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m55s">follow</a> 00:35:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h35m57s">Simply observe how they go</a> 00:35:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m01s">Nope now, you may say this is difficult I</a> 00:36:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m10s">Am bored by watching what is going on?</a> 00:36:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m15s">Let's say use that you either sit quite still and you are simply observing. What is happening?</a> 00:36:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m25s">all the sounds outside</a> 00:36:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m27s">all the different shapes and light in front of your eyes all the</a> 00:36:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m33s">Feelings on your skin inside your skin belly rumbles a thoughts going on inside your head Chatta Chatta Chatta</a> 00:36:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m39s">I ought to be writing a [letter] [to] [them] so I should have done</a> 00:36:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m43s">This is that all of the bills going on that you just watch it, but then you say to yourself. It isn't boring</a> 00:36:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m52s">Now watch that [too]</a> 00:36:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h36m56s">What is it what what kind of a funny feeling is it that makes you say, but this is for it</a> 00:36:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m01s">Where is it? [where] [do] you feel it? I should be doing [something] else instead</a> 00:37:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m08s">What's that see?</a> 00:37:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m10s">What part of your body is it in is it in here? Is it in here? [it's] in the soles of your feet</a> 00:37:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m16s">Where is it?</a> 00:37:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m17s">Bori the feeling of boredom can be very interesting if you're trying to look it up</a> 00:37:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m24s">so you simply watch and</a> 00:37:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m26s">Everything going on without attempting to change it in any way</a> 00:37:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m32s">Without judging it without calling it good or bad that you watch it</a> 00:37:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h37m36s">That is the essential process of meditation</a> 00:37:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry94tFG4CIM#t=00h38m05s">We all know what reality is, but we come</a> 00:38:05</p>
