<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h00m12s">but it's about space and</a> 00:00:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h00m15s">In most people's minds space is just nothing</a> 00:00:15</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h00m25s">But once you get outside the air</a> 00:00:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h00m29s">Space may be in some way crossed</a> 00:00:29</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h00m58s">space is just</a> 00:00:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m01s">Isn't there it's [the] way we have in other words of talking about</a> 00:01:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m07s">distances between bodies</a> 00:01:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m10s">In other words when we say the distance between them increased</a> 00:01:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m16s">As if the distance were a substantive that does something like the man walked the distance increased</a> 00:01:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m24s">But I suppose what we are actually saying</a> 00:01:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m27s">Is that the two bodies we are talking about?</a> 00:01:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m30s">increased</a> 00:01:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m32s">The distance between themselves, they did it</a> 00:01:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m35s">But then you suddenly find that you've got distance as an object</a> 00:01:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m39s">They increase the distance the distance now being the object of the verb whereas before it was the substance</a> 00:01:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m45s">this is the subject and</a> 00:01:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m48s">so</a> 00:01:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m49s">At once one begins to see there's something fishy about space</a> 00:01:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m54s">and</a> 00:01:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h01m57s">After all it is the background</a> 00:01:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m03s">against which we see everything and</a> 00:02:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m06s">even a blind person</a> 00:02:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m09s">Has a sense of space?</a> 00:02:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m12s">in that which does not obstruct motion</a> 00:02:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m19s">And yet funny thing about space is [that] in a way, it doesn't end</a> 00:02:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m27s">We're a solid begins</a> 00:02:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m32s">you could shift a solid around in space without apparently altering it in any way and</a> 00:02:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m39s">After all there is space between the two sides shall we say or ends of the solid</a> 00:02:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m46s">We can think of that in terms of space and measure it in terms of space</a> 00:02:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m52s">But it is against space</a> 00:02:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m55s">that we experience everything that we experience and</a> 00:02:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h02m59s">By the way also we experience everything not only in the dimension of space, but also the dimension of time</a> 00:02:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m08s">now the fascination about space and time is</a> 00:03:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m13s">That while they [are] basic to all possible experiences that we have</a> 00:03:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m20s">You just can't put your finger on</a> 00:03:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m24s">Space seems to be completely immaterial</a> 00:03:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m29s">And when [Saint] augustine was asked what [is] time? He said I know what it is, but when you ask me, I don't</a> 00:03:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m41s">So these two basic dimensions of our physical world</a> 00:03:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m47s">are</a> 00:03:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m48s">uncommonly elusive</a> 00:03:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m53s">We could perhaps say</a> 00:03:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h03m57s">That they are pure abstractions</a> 00:03:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m00s">There is no such thing as space, and there is no such thing as time</a> 00:04:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m06s">they are merely our way of</a> 00:04:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m09s">measuring and</a> 00:04:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m11s">thinking about</a> 00:04:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m13s">the behavior of the Physical Universe as</a> 00:04:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m16s">a pattern a system of patterns</a> 00:04:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m19s">energy Patterns and</a> 00:04:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m22s">if you measure the movement of these patterns</a> 00:04:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m26s">[the] line along which you measure motion is called the time line</a> 00:04:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m31s">if you measure their positions the line along which you measure their positions you would call the space line and</a> 00:04:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m39s">these two lines would [be] as abstract as</a> 00:04:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m42s">the</a> 00:04:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m44s">the equator in relation to longitude zero</a> 00:04:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m50s">These things don't exist on the physical face of the of the world</a> 00:04:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h04m55s">They are Imaginary lines and are only to be found on maps</a> 00:04:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m01s">Is it could you also say that the same thing was [true] of time and space?</a> 00:05:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m10s">We think for example that there are three coordinates of space and one of time?</a> 00:05:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m18s">the three coordinates of space being</a> 00:05:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m22s">length Breadth and depth and</a> 00:05:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m27s">Through that runs one of time</a> 00:05:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m31s">But come to think of it</a> 00:05:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m32s">It's rather artificial</a> 00:05:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m34s">it is making us [think] of space as having a sort of grain to it as if it were a crystalline substance and</a> 00:05:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m42s">however transparent the Crystal it does have a grain and</a> 00:05:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m45s">space has the grain of [uppercross] and through</a> 00:05:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m50s">those are the three ways [in] which we think of space and</a> 00:05:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m55s">We can't think of any more</a> 00:05:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m58s">not</a> 00:05:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h05m59s">with our senses we can um</a> 00:05:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h06m05s">mathematically conceive</a> 00:06:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h06m08s">spaces with infinitely many dimensions</a> 00:06:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h06m11s">That is to say you can write it down as [if] it were so</a> 00:06:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h06m16s">But you can't conceive it in your imagination you</a> 00:06:16</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h06m55s">that obviously you can't have more than</a> 00:06:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m02s">the three right angular dimensions of space or the coordinates</a> 00:07:02</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m16s">And so you can think about it</a> 00:07:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m18s">in terms of mathematics</a> 00:07:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m21s">But you can't conceive more than these three coordinates</a> 00:07:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m25s">since sensuously</a> 00:07:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m29s">And so we begin it's it's basic common sense to us that space has this structure</a> 00:07:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m37s">but of course</a> 00:07:37</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m39s">Question is is this a structure of space?</a> 00:07:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m43s">Or is it a structure of the human nervous system the human brain and human thought?</a> 00:07:43</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m54s">This is one way of approaching the problem</a> 00:07:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h07m59s">But there's another way altogether</a> 00:07:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h08m03s">which is to consider space as</a> 00:08:03</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h08m18s">You might say then that space</a> 00:08:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h08m22s">Is as near as we can imagine?</a> 00:08:22</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h08m47s">to mean the ultimate reality</a> 00:08:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h08m52s">Space is used in Indian Basic Indian Philosophy in Vedanta. It is called Akasha and</a> 00:08:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h09m03s">Akasha is for them the fundamental element there are five elements Earth water air and fire and akash and</a> 00:09:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h09m11s">So space contains all the other elements</a> 00:09:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h09m15s">In Buddhist Philosophy where the ultimate reality is called Shunyata the void</a> 00:09:15</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h14m29s">You will recognize a pattern</a> 00:14:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h14m32s">But you see at once that the pattern depends on the way the critical dots in it are spaced</a> 00:14:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h14m43s">And it doesn't matter much whether the space is a big space, or whether it's a little one</a> 00:14:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h14m50s">Because it will always be relative to the size of the dots</a> 00:14:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h14m55s">[you] can magnify it or minify it</a> 00:14:55</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h15m05s">Transitive verb now</a> 00:15:05</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h15m16s">And now we can talk about space as a verb to space to be spaced</a> 00:15:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h15m24s">and</a> 00:15:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h15m25s">So once again the language is either</a> 00:15:25</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h15m50s">But here at once you see especially in that illustration of music of it</a> 00:15:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h15m55s">Being necessary to hear intervals in order to hear melody</a> 00:15:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h16m00s">You see that the way things are spaced is really another way of talking about the way [things] are related</a> 00:16:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h16m14s">So you begin [to] [realize] that space is relationship?</a> 00:16:14</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h20m31s">Namely that every thing event in the world</a> 00:20:31</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h20m43s">Then you want to identify the wiggles in the pattern</a> 00:20:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h20m46s">very difficult to to</a> 00:20:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h20m49s">determine how much of a wiggle makes one wiggle</a> 00:20:49</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h20m57s">We say all this wiggly world consists of so many wiggles and each individual wiggle is a thing event</a> 00:20:57</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h21m08s">[JI] means a thing event and</a> 00:21:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h21m12s">So the idea of new doctrine of mutual interpenetration is that everything event in the universe</a> 00:21:12</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m01s">This is the other aspect of it</a> 00:23:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m06s">and this is the difficult one to understand and</a> 00:23:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m09s">We shall be able to approach this in the course of the seminar in</a> 00:23:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m14s">Fact if you realize that then you've really got it you've got the point of your own existence</a> 00:23:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m22s">But to get the reverse picture</a> 00:23:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m25s">You have first of all to get clearly</a> 00:23:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m28s">Its opposite one namely that the existence of any one my new little thing is</a> 00:23:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m35s">intimately related to everything</a> 00:23:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m41s">And then you can you what happens when you clearly understand that and you've really [got] that</a> 00:23:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m47s">Your mind does a flip [boom] like that. It's like when you squeeze the air into a</a> 00:23:47</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m54s">and you get all the air squeezed up you think into one end of the balloon and something goes bloop and</a> 00:23:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h23m59s">It comes off the other end you see well. It's sort of like that</a> 00:23:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h24m04s">And you have to be very careful at that point not to go crazy</a> 00:24:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h24m09s">But we're cause you see when you find out</a> 00:24:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h24m13s">That all this universe depends on you</a> 00:24:13</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h24m31s">You have to discover that and then be natural</a> 00:24:31</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h24m45s">so then this</a> 00:24:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h24m49s">buddhist idea of Mahayana Buddhist idea of Mutual interpenetration</a> 00:24:49</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeIuzXQcdU#t=00h34m56s">Because now [when] [otis] oficer de strana tries to tell you that space is finite</a> 00:34:56</p>
