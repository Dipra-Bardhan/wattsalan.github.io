<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m03s">You see, what happens is this then:</a> 00:00:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m06s">that an individual who all his life long has played the social game</a> 00:00:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m13s">then says: &quot;Well, now I've done that, I have assumed this role, I have become identified with tinker, tailer, soldier, sailer, whatever it was ...</a> 00:00:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m23s">... but now: 'Who am I?' ... really!</a> 00:00:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m26s">In order to find that out I have to go off by myself. Why?</a> 00:00:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m31s">Because ... you have a role conception, a mask conception of yourself ...</a> 00:00:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m40s">because other people tell you who you are!</a> 00:00:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m46s">We are constantly - in every social interchange, in the most common remarks - telling other people who they are.</a> 00:00:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h00m59s">Everything leads up to that. The way I act towards you, the way you act towards me tells me who I am and tells you who you are.</a> 00:00:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m09s">For example, you come and sit here listen to me talk.</a> 00:01:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m12s">You are by doing that telling me I am some kind of a teacher.</a> 00:01:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m16s">And you're telling yourselves that you're some kind of students.</a> 00:01:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m20s">And that's only one thing, you see, one little incident.</a> 00:01:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m24s">In business every day, in your house work and everything you do</a> 00:01:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m29s">everybody around you is telling you what you are and who you are by expecting certain behaviour from you</a> 00:01:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m37s">which - if you are a reasonable and socially inclined person - you perform, because that's what's expected of you.</a> 00:01:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m43s">So you are told who you are!</a> 00:01:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m45s">See, it's not much fun to be happy and not know it.</a> 00:01:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m50s">We need a certain resonance. Self-consciousness is an echo in our heads ...</a> 00:01:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h01m57s">... an echo of what we do, but wouldn't be aware of doing it if there wasn't an echo.</a> 00:01:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m04s">When you see yourself in a mirror, that mirror is a visual echo of your face.</a> 00:02:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m10s">And that's why in a room such as this, it's very comfortable room for me to talk in - because it has resonance.</a> 00:02:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m19s">And so self-consciousness is neurological resonance.</a> 00:02:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m25s">Now you know how troublesome resonance can get if it's not properly worked out.</a> 00:02:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m31s">You can get echoes that just won't stop.</a> 00:02:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m35s">So you go into a great cave somewhere and say: &quot;Hi.&quot; And it does: &quot;hi,&quot; &quot;hi,&quot; &quot;hi,&quot; &quot;hi,&quot;</a> 00:02:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m44s">That's very confusing. Now that's the sort of ? that self-consciousness can get in to ... and we call it anxiety.</a> 00:02:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h02m54s">When I keep keep keep thinking: &quot;Did I do the right thing?&quot;</a> 00:02:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m02s">If I am constantly aware of myself in a kind of anxious, critical way, my resonance becomes too high</a> 00:03:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m11s">and so I get confused and jittery.</a> 00:03:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m16s">But, if you learn that self-consciousness has limits,<br />that self-awareness cannot possibly enable you to be free of making mistakes.</a> 00:03:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m37s">You can learn to be spontaneous in spite of being self-aware ...</a> 00:03:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m44s">... and enjoy the echo!</a> 00:03:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m50s">And so you can have this sensation, you see, of total unity with the cosmos ...</a> 00:03:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h03m58s">of the - shall I call it expansion to infinity or contraction to infinity - ...</a> 00:03:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m04s">... of your identity</a> 00:04:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m08s">without forgetting</a> 00:04:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m11s">society's game rules with regard to you.</a> 00:04:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m15s">in other words</a> 00:04:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m17s">it doesn't mean that you forget your address, telephone number, social security number</a> 00:04:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m21s">and the name you were given.</a> 00:04:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m24s">You remember all that and you can play that game when necessary</a> 00:04:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m30s">but you know it's a game!</a> 00:04:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m35s">So, there is no way - as a matter of fact - of escaping from playing these games</a> 00:04:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m42s">And the only thing is that when you find out, that you are thoroughly selfish</a> 00:04:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m51s">you inquire: &quot;What is it? What is the self that I love?&quot;</a> 00:04:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h04m58s">What is this thing that I am so interested in advancing and in protecting?</a> 00:04:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m05s">And you look very closely in to what you feel when you think you feel yourself!</a> 00:05:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m10s">And you know what you find out?</a> 00:05:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m13s">That your Self is everything that you thought was someone else</a> 00:05:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m18s">or something else.</a> 00:05:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m21s">You have no knowledge of yourself, you see! Except in relation to others!</a> 00:05:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m27s">Self and other are as inseparable as back and front!</a> 00:05:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m32s">There is no knowledge of self without the knowledge of other-ness,</a> 00:05:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m35s">there is no knowledge of the voluntary without the knowledge of the involuntary,</a> 00:05:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m39s">of can without can't</a> 00:05:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m42s">so they go together!</a> 00:05:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m43s">And that going together of Self and other is non-duality, that's advaita!</a> 00:05:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m48s">That is the Self with a capital &quot;S.&quot;</a> 00:05:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h05m55s">So, through Self one finds deliverance from self.</a> 00:05:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m08s">And so finally, we come to the last consideration</a> 00:06:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m14s">which is the question</a> 00:06:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m16s">in what way and by what means</a> 00:06:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m20s">can an individual</a> 00:06:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m23s">who is under the impression that he is a separate individual</a> 00:06:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m28s">limited by and enclosed in by his bag of skin</a> 00:06:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m33s">how can such a person effectively realize that he is deep down the universal Self - the Brahman?</a> 00:06:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m50s">This of course</a> 00:06:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m52s">is a curious question!</a> 00:06:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h06m55s">It proposes a journey to the place where you already are!</a> 00:06:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m02s">Now, it's true, that you may not know that you are there</a> 00:07:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m07s">but you are!</a> 00:07:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m09s">And if you take a journey to the place where you are,</a> 00:07:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m12s">you will visit many other places than the place where you are.</a> 00:07:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m18s">and perhaps</a> 00:07:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m21s">when you find through some long experience</a> 00:07:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m25s">that all the places you go to</a> 00:07:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m27s">are not the places you wanted to find!</a> 00:07:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeGzuXS9Eeg#t=00h07m30s">It may occur to you that you were already there in the beginning!</a> 00:07:30</p>
