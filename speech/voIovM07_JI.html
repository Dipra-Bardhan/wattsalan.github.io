<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m03s">Go back to your childhood</a> 00:00:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m05s">what were the fascinating things?</a> 00:00:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m08s">What's out there?</a> 00:00:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m11s">What's beyond the stars?</a> 00:00:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m13s">How long does it go on?</a> 00:00:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m16s">and mamma said, &quot;It goes on always and always and always.&quot;</a> 00:00:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m23s">the child wonders</a> 00:00:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m24s">it's excited</a> 00:00:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m26s">that there's something that never ends</a> 00:00:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m29s">then the child asks about time</a> 00:00:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m31s">How long ago is long ago?</a> 00:00:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m35s">well</a> 00:00:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m36s">the Bible says that in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth</a> 00:00:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m40s">well what did God do before he did that?</a> 00:00:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m43s">as one person said, he sat up thinking punishments in Hell for people who ask silly questions</a> 00:00:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m50s">but, still, that is only a joke</a> 00:00:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m53s">and the child thinks of God</a> 00:00:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m56s">going back and back and back forever</a> 00:00:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h00m59s">but never beginning</a> 00:00:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m02s">so, in the same way you think about death</a> 00:01:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m06s">go to sleep and never wake up... never</a> 00:01:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m13s">why, it would be as if you never had existed</a> 00:01:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m16s">not only you but everything else</a> 00:01:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m20s">which is, of course, the way things were before you were born</a> 00:01:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m24s">I mean, just turn it backwards...</a> 00:01:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m27s">you know, how about waking up after having never gone to sleep?</a> 00:01:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m33s">that's quite a thought</a> 00:01:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m36s">there's something fishy about it all</a> 00:01:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m44s">so we get a funny feeling</a> 00:01:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m46s">when we think those questions really through</a> 00:01:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m51s">a very funny feeling...</a> 00:01:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m56s">and children, you see, love to get into that funny feeling</a> 00:01:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h01m59s">children do all kinds of weird things</a> 00:01:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m01s">they like to spin around as fast as possible, so they watch, suddenly, that all the ground goes tilting</a> 00:02:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m07s">and they make faces</a> 00:02:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m08s">and test out their bodies in all sorts of funny ways</a> 00:02:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m12s">because they know from the beginning that the world is weird</a> 00:02:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m18s">a strange thing</a> 00:02:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m21s">because everybody knows</a> 00:02:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m24s">what it's all about, only they won't admit it</a> 00:02:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m27s">being brought up is being taught not to admit it</a> 00:02:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m31s">but you know very well</a> 00:02:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m33s">what's going on</a> 00:02:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m37s">but in order to find out once more as an adult you have to become again as a child</a> 00:02:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m46s">see, we are in Heaven now</a> 00:02:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m49s">because the Earth is a spaceship</a> 00:02:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voIovM07_JI#t=00h02m52s">and 'Heaven' is space</a> 00:02:52</p>
