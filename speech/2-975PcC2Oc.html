<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h00m00s">I'm going to talk to you this evening on the subject of the spectrum of love we</a> 00:00:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h00m09s">know that from time to time there arise among human beings people who seem to</a> 00:00:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h00m18s">exude love as naturally as the Sun gives out heat we would like to be like that</a> 00:00:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h00m28s">and by and large man's religions are attempts to cultivate that same power in</a> 00:00:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h00m39s">ordinary people but unfortunately they normally go about this task as one would</a> 00:00:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h00m47s">attempt to make the tail wag the dog</a> 00:00:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h00m50s">I remember when I was a small boy in school I was an honest interested in</a> 00:00:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h00m58s">being able to do my school work properly and everybody told me that I didn't work</a> 00:00:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m06s">hard enough and that I ought to work i have an intense desire to do this but</a> 00:01:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m12s">when i asked how do you work</a> 00:01:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m14s">everybody shut up like a clown so I was extremely puzzled but there were</a> 00:01:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m21s">teachers who apparently knew how to work in the detained considerable height of</a> 00:01:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m26s">scholarship and I admire them very much for their attainment and so I thought</a> 00:01:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m31s">that maybe I could learn the secret by copying their mannerisms I would imitate</a> 00:01:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m37s">the style of handwriting that they used i would use the same kind of 10 I would</a> 00:01:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m42s">affect the same mannerisms of speech and gesture and insofar as i could get</a> 00:01:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m47s">around the school uniform even clothing i must assure you with this of course</a> 00:01:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m51s">was a private school in Indian not a public school in America but none of</a> 00:01:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h01m57s">this revealed the secret because i was as it were copying the outward symptoms</a> 00:01:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h02m04s">and knew nothing of the inner mountain are being able to work and exactly the</a> 00:02:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h02m11s">same thing is true in the case of people who love when we study the behavior of</a> 00:02:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h02m17s">people who have the power of love within them we can catalog how they behave in</a> 00:02:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h02m24s">various situations and out of this catalog formulate some rules one of the</a> 00:02:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h02m31s">peculiar things we notice about people who have this astonishing universal love</a> 00:02:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h02m38s">is that they are apt but not always so but they are a very often to play it</a> 00:02:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h02m46s">rather cool on sexual love the reason for this is generally speaking unknown</a> 00:02:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h02m53s">to preachers but it is because an erotic relationship with the external world</a> 00:02:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m02s">operates so far as they're concerned between that world and every single</a> 00:03:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m07s">nerve ending they are whole organism in all its aspects physical psychological</a> 00:03:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m15s">and spiritual is an erogenous zone and therefore they are flow of love is not</a> 00:03:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m22s">specialized are catalyzed so exclusively in the genital system as it is with most</a> 00:03:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m29s">other people especially in a culture such as ours where for so many centuries</a> 00:03:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m35s">that particular expression of erotic love has been so marvelously repressed</a> 00:03:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m42s">as to make it seemed the most desirable kind of love that there is and so we</a> 00:03:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m48s">have as a result of two thousand years of Christianity sex on the brain</a> 00:03:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h03m58s">it doesn't always the right place for it</a> 00:03:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h04m02s">of course also people who exude love our apt to give things away they are in</a> 00:04:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h04m14s">every way like rivers they stream and so when they connect possessions and things</a> 00:04:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h04m19s">that they like they are apt to give them to other people because when you have</a> 00:04:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h04m26s">you ever noticed that when you start giving things away you keep getting more</a> 00:04:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h04m29s">the same way as you empty out you create a vacuum nature of positive vacuum and</a> 00:04:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h04m35s">more flows in so we're noticing this Dakota fires of nothing behavior right</a> 00:04:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h04m42s">down that you should give so much money to tax deductible institutions and to</a> 00:04:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h04m52s">the poor and that you should be nice to people that you should act towards your</a> 00:04:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m00s">relatives and your friends and even your enemies as if you love them even if you</a> 00:05:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m05s">don't</a> 00:05:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m06s">and of course for Christians and Jews and believers in God there is a</a> 00:05:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m10s">peculiarly difficult task and joined upon us namely that thou shalt love the</a> 00:05:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m15s">Lord thy God and not only here going through the motions of it externally but</a> 00:05:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m20s">with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind and that is of</a> 00:05:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m25s">course very demanding indeed but you see what is happening</a> 00:05:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m31s">it is as if for example we admire the music of a certain composer and having</a> 00:05:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m37s">started his style</a> 00:05:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m40s">verily we draw up rules of musical composition based on the behavior of</a> 00:05:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m45s">this composer we then go to mute send our children to music school where they</a> 00:05:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m51s">learn these rules in the hope that if they apply them they also will turn into</a> 00:05:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h05m55s">first class musicians which they usually fail to do because what might be called</a> 00:05:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m02s">the technique of music as well as the technique of morals as well as say the</a> 00:06:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m07s">technique of speech of language is very valuable because it gives you</a> 00:06:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m12s">something to express if and I repeat if you have anything to express but if you</a> 00:06:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m18s">don't if you don't have anything to say not even the greatest master of English</a> 00:06:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m22s">will stand you in good stead unless you can manage to fool your listeners by</a> 00:06:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m30s">talking beautiful nonsense and make it sound profound now so the question and</a> 00:06:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m39s">the possible remains you cannot imitate this thing there is no way of getting it</a> 00:06:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m45s">and yet it is absolutely essential that we have it because obviously the human</a> 00:06:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m52s">race is not going to flourish harmoniously unless we are unable to</a> 00:06:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h06m57s">love each other but the question is how do you get it is it something you simply</a> 00:06:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m03s">have to contract like measles or is a theologian say is it's a gift of divine</a> 00:07:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m10s">grace which somehow is dished out to some but not to others and if there is</a> 00:07:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m16s">no way of getting divine grace buy anything you do as the Calvinist server</a> 00:07:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m20s">then we've got to just sit around and wait until something happens</a> 00:07:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m26s">although Calvin is never did that</a> 00:07:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m29s">they were almost depressing the energetic</a> 00:07:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m36s">but surely we can't be left in that kind of a hopeless situation there must be</a> 00:07:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m41s">some way of getting the grace or getting divine charity or love some sort of</a> 00:07:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m47s">wangle some sort of way in which we can as it were open ourselves even so as to</a> 00:07:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h07m53s">become hundred pipes for the flow and so the more subtle features try to see if</a> 00:07:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m04s">we can open ourselves and teach methods of meditation and spiritual discipline</a> 00:08:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m09s">in the hope that we can contact this power the less subtle creatures simply</a> 00:08:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m14s">say you don't have enough faith you don't have enough guts you don't have</a> 00:08:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m20s">enough willpower if you only put your wheel</a> 00:08:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m23s">I mean your shoulders of the wheel and shoved you would be of course an example</a> 00:08:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m28s">on the same actually you will only be an extremely clever hypocrite the whole</a> 00:08:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m35s">history of religion is a history of the failure of preaching preaching is moral</a> 00:08:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m44s">violence</a> 00:08:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m49s">if you you know when you deal with the so-called practical world and people</a> 00:08:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h08m56s">don't behave as you would wish they would you get out the army all the</a> 00:08:56</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-975PcC2Oc#t=00h09m26s">commanding people to love many as a parent says to the child nice children</a> 00:09:26</p>
