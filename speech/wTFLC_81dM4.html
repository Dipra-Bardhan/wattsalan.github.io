<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h05m35s">And it's going to be just marvelous if I'd been [born]</a> 00:05:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m19s">it's</a> 00:06:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m25s">They went when we had birth problems see all women used to think that birth</a> 00:06:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m30s">Had to be painful. It was good for them</a> 00:06:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m33s">[there's] [other] things you had to suffer because you didn't you'd been screwing around with people and therefore</a> 00:06:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m37s">if you [had] to have a child and it's gotta hurt and</a> 00:06:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m41s">Then the doctors got together and they scratch their heads and the man called granted agreed said no both doesn't hurt. It's natural</a> 00:06:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m50s">Didn't all we've got to do is to talk these women into the idea that it doesn't hurt [that] all these</a> 00:06:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m55s">so-called pains are just tensions and</a> 00:06:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h06m57s">That birth is great. It's not a disease not really something you ought [to] go to a [hospital] for</a> 00:06:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m04s">Because you associate hospitals with diseases and sitting [rather] [than] sickness</a> 00:07:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m09s">All right, now. Let's do some new thinking. What about death is death to you</a> 00:07:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m13s">Or is it a healthy natural event like being born of course it is</a> 00:07:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m19s">So I mean it's a little change in social attitude about this will fortify everybody else</a> 00:07:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m24s">Meaning I'm if I'm alone, and all my relatives</a> 00:07:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m29s">[Ammmm]</a> 00:07:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m30s">Pretending to me. It's going to be hard for me</a> 00:07:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m32s">I've got a challenge the whole bunch of them get my dander up and say listen damn you</a> 00:07:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m36s">I don't want all this thing around here. You've got to take a different [attitude] about my death. Well, that's hard</a> 00:07:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m43s">But if everybody helps me and we do we're all one body they all come around and say congratulations are in the dark</a> 00:07:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m54s">liberation liberation now</a> 00:07:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h07m57s">Because just before you die. I mean I know very well a skilful priest handling a person dying can do this one</a> 00:07:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m06s">But he has to talk very very very straight</a> 00:08:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m11s">And you have to say listen these doctors. You don't don't you pay any attention to them?</a> 00:08:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m16s">They're trying to amuse you and deceive you you're going to die</a> 00:08:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m19s">This isn't terrible</a> 00:08:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m22s">but it's just going to be the end of you as</a> 00:08:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m25s">a system of memories and</a> 00:08:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m28s">So you've got a great chance right now before it happens, so let go of everything</a> 00:08:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m34s">As you know it's going to go and is this going to help you. It's going to help you let go of everything</a> 00:08:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h08m39s">so</a> 00:08:39</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h09m45s">If you have anything to say that is you felt the water say before you [died] and if you were kind of hanging on to</a> 00:09:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h09m51s">It bothering you say it I?</a> 00:09:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h09m54s">Mean [I] don't mean necessarily a last confession</a> 00:09:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h09m57s">But say it said that I'd lie Stevenson shortly before he died said that</a> 00:09:57</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h10m07s">You know he had to get that off his chest because he had a little thought in the back of his mind that things were</a> 00:10:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h10m11s">catching up with him you see</a> 00:10:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTFLC_81dM4#t=00h10m15s">so the moment comes when this thing called death has to be</a> 00:10:15</p>
