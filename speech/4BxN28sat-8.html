<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m01s">But the real joke is natural</a> 00:00:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m04s">the resolution of anxiety.</a> 00:00:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m10s">Stress is important,</a> 00:00:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m14s">and anxiety is a state of trembling.</a> 00:00:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m18s">Stress finds us when we can not decide,</a> 00:00:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m23s">which direction to take or what course things will get.</a> 00:00:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m28s">And so we shake between the alternatives.</a> 00:00:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m35s">Now, as we naturally tremble between the alternatives</a> 00:00:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m39s">because we have the illusion that it matters a lot what these two things are happening.</a> 00:00:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m50s">Now, once you see the nature of the game,</a> 00:00:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h00m55s">you realize that it is superficial what these two things happen,</a> 00:00:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m00s">but it is not really important because,</a> 00:01:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m07s">all the negative things mate with the positive ones.</a> 00:01:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m12s">There is no positive without negative,</a> 00:01:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m15s">as well as there is no negative without a positive.</a> 00:01:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m20s">I've heard a pretty enjoyable story that goes some way like that.</a> 00:01:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m26s">The question is: Is a zebra a white horse with black stripes,</a> 00:01:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m31s">or a black horse with white stripes?</a> 00:01:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m35s">The answer is. He is an invisible horse,</a> 00:01:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m38s">which has been painted with white and black stripes so that people do not fall on it.</a> 00:01:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m50s">Now, in a similar way</a> 00:01:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h01m53s">reality is an invisible state of affairs beyond description and thought,</a> 00:01:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m00s">but which has been painted with &quot;white and black stripes&quot; to make it look.</a> 00:02:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m07s">And that is life and death, up and down, sound and silence</a> 00:02:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m12s">the whole vibratory nature of existence.</a> 00:02:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m15s">And the game, the fundamental game that plays the universe is to forget that this is happening.</a> 00:02:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m23s">You see, what you can say in theological language:</a> 00:02:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m26s">The invisibility of God is his amnesia.</a> 00:02:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m32s">And the visibility of the World is the game being played.</a> 00:02:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m37s">Now, the nature of the game</a> 00:02:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m39s">- I think to some of you I said earlier, but some have not heard it.</a> 00:02:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m43s">The nature of the game,</a> 00:02:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m47s">is &quot;Let's pretend that the positive and the negative</a> 00:02:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h02m56s">they are not actually identical. &quot;</a> 00:02:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m03s">You see, they are clearly different, but indirectly the same</a> 00:03:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m08s">because they always go together.</a> 00:03:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m12s">And this reveals a hidden native conspiracy</a> 00:03:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m16s">between black and white.</a> 00:03:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m20s">And the truth is you can not have one without the other.</a> 00:03:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m24s">But if we can pretend not to go along,</a> 00:03:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m27s">that they are actually enemies, then we can have all kinds of toys.</a> 00:03:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m32s">The first game that is &quot;Oh my God the black may win.&quot;</a> 00:03:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m37s">The next game is &quot;But the white must win.&quot;</a> 00:03:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m41s">And from this position you can develop as many games as you want.</a> 00:03:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m47s">And it's interesting - is not it? - how so many of our board games,</a> 00:03:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m52s">such as chess and dominoes and queen,</a> 00:03:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h03m57s">and so on use the black and white pieces.</a> 00:03:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m03s">And you can find the rules of chess,</a> 00:04:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m06s">- one could look at all the problems in terms of chess -</a> 00:04:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m10s">when I mention the joker, of course, we look at it in terms of card games.</a> 00:04:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m15s">Because the joker is the card over the role.</a> 00:04:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m19s">The card is free,</a> 00:04:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m21s">which can be any card in the deck.</a> 00:04:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m27s">In other words, it is free to be a certain person.</a> 00:04:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m32s">And it can be anybody.</a> 00:04:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m35s">And it rises here, and rises there, and further,</a> 00:04:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m38s">and you never know who the joker is, who is the joker. You see;</a> 00:04:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m43s">The thing we have to really understand</a> 00:04:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m47s">is that all the roles are the joker playing them.</a> 00:04:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m53s">And the joker looks at you all the pairs of eyes.</a> 00:04:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m57s">There it is.</a> 00:04:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h04m59s">Only pretending to be the joker is not at all.</a> 00:04:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxN28sat-8#t=00h05m03s">&quot;Oh no, it's just me, I'm not the joker. Where's the joker?&quot;</a> 00:05:03</p>
