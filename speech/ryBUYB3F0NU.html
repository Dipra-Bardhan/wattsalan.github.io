<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m03s">So this goes very deep</a> 00:00:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m05s">to us. It goes deep deep</a> 00:00:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m08s">in on a problem we have with debt. I often wonder if there is a relationship</a> 00:00:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m15s">exists between debt and gold.</a> 00:00:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m18s">That the love of money is the root of evil.</a> 00:00:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m21s">It is a very true saying. Because you see</a> 00:00:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m26s">I said yesterday that the difference between having a job</a> 00:00:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m30s">and a calling is that a job</a> 00:00:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m34s">an unpleasant job is that you do to make money.</a> 00:00:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m39s">For the sole purpose of earning money. And ah ...</a> 00:00:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m45s">There are still enough jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work</a> 00:00:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m48s">that nobody wants to do and so they will pay someone to do that.</a> 00:00:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m51s">There is, in principle, less and less of that type of work</a> 00:00:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m57s">mechanization.</a> 00:00:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h00m59s">But if you work, if you work</a> 00:00:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m02s">for the sole purpose of earning money, you are absurd.</a> 00:01:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m06s">Because</a> 00:01:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m10s">when money becomes your goal, and that becomes when you work like that,</a> 00:01:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m15s">Then you will</a> 00:01:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m18s">that increasingly confuse with happiness - or with pleasure.</a> 00:01:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m23s">Yes, you can fill a whole hand</a> 00:01:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m27s">have new dollar bills and practically mouth watering.</a> 00:01:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m30s">But this is the kind of person who is confused, like a Pavlov dog</a> 00:01:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m35s">that water tooth over the wrong bell.</a> 00:01:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m38s">(laughter)</a> 00:01:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m44s">You see, it comes back up</a> 00:01:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m49s">the time-honored feeling</a> 00:01:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m55s">if you do not work, you are not entitled to eat.</a> 00:01:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h01m59s">That if there are others in the world who do not have enough to eat</a> 00:01:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m07s">that you can not enjoy your food even though you have no way to</a> 00:02:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m11s">Which</a> 00:02:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m12s">to transfer food to them.</a> 00:02:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m17s">And while it is true that we are all</a> 00:02:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m21s">to be one human family and that each individual relates to each other</a> 00:02:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m26s">individual...</a> 00:02:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m27s">While it is true that we thereby</a> 00:02:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m31s">should do something to change the situation.</a> 00:02:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m35s">The only way to change nothing about a situation</a> 00:02:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m40s">you feel guilty about it, because when people feel guilty about a situation</a> 00:02:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m46s">then instead of practically doing something to change it, they go back to</a> 00:02:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m51s">all kinds of symbolic</a> 00:02:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m53s">ways of reimbursement. They go to confession.</a> 00:02:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h02m56s">They go to an analyst.</a> 00:02:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m00s">They do everything that is ways</a> 00:03:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m04s">not to do something about the problem, but to feel better about it.</a> 00:03:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m10s">And guilt always produces such reactions.</a> 00:03:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m14s">It is a destructive emotion. And</a> 00:03:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m20s">instead of that we have to change our attitude towards our mistakes</a> 00:03:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m26s">and have misdeeds. Walt Whitman has always admired animals because they are not at night</a> 00:03:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m34s">lie awake at night and cry for their sins.</a> 00:03:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m36s">Animals are practical</a> 00:03:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m40s">in the same sense as children</a> 00:03:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m44s">who have not previously made that special</a> 00:03:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m47s">compulsive thought of guilt has been learned.</a> 00:03:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m50s">Because if you have done something wrong</a> 00:03:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h03m55s">you made a mistake and someone was shaming you and making you guilty,</a> 00:03:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m01s">then you run around</a> 00:04:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m04s">to lick the wounds of your ego because you feel that your honor has been violated.</a> 00:04:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m11s">The first thing you have to understand is</a> 00:04:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m15s">that it is not a serious failure in a person</a> 00:04:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m21s">to make mistakes. Everyone has to make mistakes. There is no escape.</a> 00:04:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m28s">You can not learn anything without making mistakes first. For example, in Japan you see</a> 00:04:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m33s">the Japanese have a terrible attitude about making mistakes.</a> 00:04:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m38s">As a result, they never have the courage to practice their English well.</a> 00:04:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m44s">They had seven years of English in school,</a> 00:04:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m47s">most of which is very badly learned.</a> 00:04:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m51s">And it is irrelevant English. They learn</a> 00:04:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m54s">everything about Shakespear and</a> 00:04:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h04m58s">Dickens and Thackery and Thomas Hardy and so on,</a> 00:04:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m02s">and therefore they can not hold an everyday conversation.</a> 00:05:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m07s">It is like the English study French. Everything about pens of aunts from gardening</a> 00:05:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m11s">and things like that.</a> 00:05:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m13s">And so they are ashamed</a> 00:05:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m17s">to practice their English unless they are drunk.</a> 00:05:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m21s">So if you want to have a conversation with a Japanese in English</a> 00:05:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m24s">then you have to go to bars and</a> 00:05:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m27s">there they say that university students get somewhat looser</a> 00:05:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m31s">and talk.</a> 00:05:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m34s">For they no longer have the same restraint, the shame for the wrong</a> 00:05:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m37s">to say.</a> 00:05:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m40s">And that is how I know a very good one</a> 00:05:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m43s">anthropologist who had been taught music,</a> 00:05:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m47s">To play piano in the same way as the music was taught to me.</a> 00:05:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m52s">the school mother who taught me</a> 00:05:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h05m57s">it was just an 'India rubber', and it was called rubber in this country,</a> 00:05:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m01s">to put on the top of my hands so that I kept my hands in the right posture.</a> 00:06:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m06s">And every time I played the wrong note she hit me on my fingers with a pencil.</a> 00:06:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m11s">And this great anthropologist who had the same thinking about music theory,</a> 00:06:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m16s">when he was confronted with the piano in the presence of an absolutely brilliant one</a> 00:06:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m20s">teacher in San Francisco,</a> 00:06:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m21s">She said she was surprised that he was completely incapable</a> 00:06:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m24s">read with notes. He blocked everything.</a> 00:06:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m30s">Another great one</a> 00:06:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m33s">teacher of the piano I knew simply said</a> 00:06:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m38s">you should not be afraid to play the wrong notes.</a> 00:06:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m42s">Just forget about it.</a> 00:06:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m45s">Play it wrong and</a> 00:06:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m48s">Then do it again and possibly you will succeed.</a> 00:06:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m51s">But you should not block it. Always keep the same rhythm</a> 00:06:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h06m57s">even though you have to play it quieter, but play the right rhythm</a> 00:06:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m02s">from one note to the other and if it is the wrong note, play it as long as you do</a> 00:07:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m05s">but something plays</a> 00:07:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m07s">in the right rhythm.</a> 00:07:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m11s">So you know, this is a way to</a> 00:07:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m14s">people to take away their blockage, their guilt and shame</a> 00:07:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m18s">from the mistakes they make.</a> 00:07:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m22s">So absolutely ... Freedom means</a> 00:07:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m25s">essentially the freedom to make mistakes,</a> 00:07:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m29s">the freedom to be an idiot.</a> 00:07:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m33s">And then do not accuse yourself when you find out</a> 00:07:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m37s">that it was a mistake,</a> 00:07:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m38s">but simply do not do it again.</a> 00:07:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m43s">Or at least less often.</a> 00:07:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m47s">So this is the puzzle</a> 00:07:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m51s">when you are going to confess at the Catholic Church,</a> 00:07:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m55s">What a tremendous method to instill a guilt feeling,</a> 00:07:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h07m59s">very subtle. It is, of course, said that Catholics in general</a> 00:07:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m03s">less guilty than Protestants. They are</a> 00:08:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m07s">more relaxed, and there is some truth in that. But only a little bit.</a> 00:08:07</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m12s">Protestants naturally have a chronic debt</a> 00:08:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m16s">and you can work it out with a very simple formula.</a> 00:08:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m20s">That when the protestants in England got out of hand</a> 00:08:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m24s">what ear confession is called, to a priest,</a> 00:08:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m29s">then they have a general in their prayer book</a> 00:08:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m33s">confession included in which the congregation together confesses together.</a> 00:08:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m38s">What does a Catholic say when he confesses his sins?</a> 00:08:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m43s">The formula is &quot;I confess to God Almighty, Blessed Virgin Mary,</a> 00:08:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m48s">Blessed John the Baptist, The Holy Apostles Peter and Paul and all Saints,</a> 00:08:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m51s">that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word and deed, in my error, in my own error, in mine</a> 00:08:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m55s">own worst mistake.</a> 00:08:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h08m56s">For this I request the Blessed Mary etcetera And You father to pray for me to the Lord</a> 00:08:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m01s">our God.</a> 00:09:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m05s">And the priest says &quot;Almighty God forgives You Your sins and brings You</a> 00:09:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m10s">to eternal life with the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ</a> 00:09:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m12s">entrusted to me I give you the absolution of your sins in the name of the Father, the Son</a> 00:09:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m16s">and the Holy Spirit. &quot;Point.</a> 00:09:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m19s">Now instead of what they have to introduce</a> 00:09:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m24s">with the Anglican form</a> 00:09:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m28s">was instead of this very simple confession of sins</a> 00:09:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m32s">and for the whole company in Heaven</a> 00:09:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m36s">an absolute humiliation</a> 00:09:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m40s">saying that they have sinned so badly</a> 00:09:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m44s">and that the memory of these sins hurts us so much.</a> 00:09:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m49s">That the burden of these sins like that</a> 00:09:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m49s">is unbearable. Pity us. Have pity oh most miserable Father.</a> 00:09:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m54s">And all this wailing and howling,</a> 00:09:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h09m58s">that pounding and wallowing in debt and then the priest who instead of</a> 00:09:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m02s">a simple formula of</a> 00:10:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m06s">to say absolution, to name all kinds of scriptural texts</a> 00:10:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m10s">to prove from the Bible that those who truly and sincerely regret</a> 00:10:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m14s">to be forgiven by God. Because they are extremely insecure about it, that's why they have to</a> 00:10:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m18s">name all authorities.</a> 00:10:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m20s">(laughter)</a> 00:10:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m23s">And this completely humiliating form</a> 00:10:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m26s">of the confession replaces the old because</a> 00:10:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m31s">they were a bit afraid of a direct confession of sins</a> 00:10:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m35s">to get rid of the priest.</a> 00:10:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m38s">And now returning to the Catholic problem about debt,</a> 00:10:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m44s">You say that you</a> 00:10:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m48s">have confessed after canceling this formula and</a> 00:10:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m51s">to all the saints</a> 00:10:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m54s">appoint the specific sins you committed</a> 00:10:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h10m59s">You know that I have stolen something, have committed adultery three times</a> 00:10:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m03s">and so on, whatever it was and</a> 00:11:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m06s">then you say in the end &quot;for this and all my other sins that I have not remembered now.&quot;</a> 00:11:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m10s">(laughter)</a> 00:11:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m14s">I keep firmly to change</a> 00:11:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m19s">and humbly ask for the forgiveness of God,</a> 00:11:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m23s">and from you Father, absolution.</a> 00:11:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m29s">Now, I hold fast to change, that is true</a> 00:11:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m32s">the problem is, because</a> 00:11:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m36s">the doctrine is that you have made a real confession</a> 00:11:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m40s">if you have a real intention at the same time</a> 00:11:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m44s">to act differently in the future. Now, no one</a> 00:11:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m49s">sensitive Catholic can say that without having serious concerns</a> 00:11:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m53s">whether they really are</a> 00:11:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h11m56s">not a few of those same things will happen again. So if you are an everyday Catholic</a> 00:11:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m01s">like a Mexican farmer or something like that</a> 00:12:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m04s">then you know that confession is only a safety valve. You just continue with your life,</a> 00:12:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m08s">as unconcerned as ever.</a> 00:12:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m12s">But you go to church from time to time and free yourself from the</a> 00:12:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m16s">guilt and evil. Just like going to the toilet.</a> 00:12:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m20s">But when you think more about these things</a> 00:12:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m25s">and you wonder whether you really mean what you say, whether your motive is pure</a> 00:12:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m30s">and your intentions well, then you come upon a huge blockade.</a> 00:12:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m36s">And one of the reasons that</a> 00:12:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m38s">our technology</a> 00:12:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m41s">get in the way</a> 00:12:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m45s">and being prevented from feeding the world decently</a> 00:12:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m49s">is the failure of one of our networks. It is an information network</a> 00:12:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h12m56s">and it is called money, about which we superstitious the most unbelievable</a> 00:12:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m05s">and have psychological blockages</a> 00:13:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m06s">where Freud compares to length, compares it</a> 00:13:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m11s">our valuation of money with our attitude towards feces</a> 00:13:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m15s">and a huge complicated</a> 00:13:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m19s">hope of complexes grow up around it. But money</a> 00:13:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m23s">and our psychological attitude towards money</a> 00:13:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m26s">is a big obstacle</a> 00:13:26</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m30s">for a decent development of technology</a> 00:13:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m34s">that enables it for what it is meant for</a> 00:13:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m37s">that is to save manpower, and to produce enough of it</a> 00:13:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m42s">goods, services, and so on</a> 00:13:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m45s">And so I have to introduce this with a story that is completely legendary</a> 00:13:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m51s">Indeed pretty dubious. The big banks of the world</a> 00:13:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h13m56s">were completely satisfied with the costs and security measures at some point</a> 00:13:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m02s">who had to be hit to ship gold from one bank to another.</a> 00:14:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m05s">And so they decided that</a> 00:14:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m08s">all the major banks of the world one</a> 00:14:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m12s">office on a particular island in the South Pacific</a> 00:14:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m16s">that was warm and comfortable, and that became a big store</a> 00:14:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m20s">for all the gold in the world. And they put it in large underground vaults</a> 00:14:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m25s">accessible with deep lift shafts</a> 00:14:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m27s">and then everything was that they still had to do when a bank</a> 00:14:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m31s">whether a country owed money to someone else that brought to the other side of the street.</a> 00:14:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m35s">And this was very efficient.</a> 00:14:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m38s">This went beautifully for five or six years.</a> 00:14:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m41s">And then all the presidents of the world banks came together and said</a> 00:14:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m46s">&quot;Let's hold a convention on this island with our wives and families.&quot;</a> 00:14:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m52s">About seven years after the opening day all those presidents and their</a> 00:14:52</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h14m56s">women and families to that island in the Pacific and inspected</a> 00:14:56</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m00s">Accounting.</a> 00:15:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m01s">And everything was right. Then their children said</a> 00:15:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m06s">&quot;Oh, Dad, can not we see the gold?&quot; &quot;Of course you can</a> 00:15:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m10s">see the gold. &quot;And they told the managers&quot; let's take the kids to the vaults</a> 00:15:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m14s">and show them the gold. &quot;</a> 00:15:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m15s">And the manager said &quot;Well it eh .. it does not come out right now</a> 00:15:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m24s">maybe the children would not find it really interesting</a> 00:15:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m29s">it is only boring</a> 00:15:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m31s">old gold. &quot;And the president said&quot; Oh come,</a> 00:15:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m35s">They would love it. Let's go. &quot;And there was something more around it</a> 00:15:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m39s">and postponed, and eventually it came out of that</a> 00:15:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m42s">there a catastrophic underground a few years earlier</a> 00:15:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m48s">earthquake had been and all vaults were swallowed up and all the gold</a> 00:15:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h15m53s">had disappeared. But as far as the accounting was concerned, everything was in perfect order.</a> 00:15:53</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h16m03s">What that means is meant</a> 00:16:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h16m08s">that money is nothing more than accounting.</a> 00:16:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h16m12s">It's numbers. It is a way</a> 00:16:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h16m16s">of measuring</a> 00:16:16</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h16m23s">and what the community owes you. It is, of course, as you all know</a> 00:16:23</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h16m55s">so that during the exchange the carrying of uncomfortable loads was limited</a> 00:16:55</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h17m04s">natural gold was used because gold was rare</a> 00:17:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h17m08s">and because gold was supposed to have a constant value.</a> 00:17:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h17m16s">You could think about the question when a banker buys gold</a> 00:17:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h17m21s">what is he paying for?</a> 00:17:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h17m25s">The answer is a mystery called credit.</a> 00:17:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h17m29s">Credit is accounting</a> 00:17:29</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h17m40s">people found out that there was not enough gold as the value of it</a> 00:17:40</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h17m54s">and services</a> 00:17:54</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h18m03s">There is something in our psychology where prices tend to keep going up</a> 00:18:03</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h18m19s">all major industrial nations were heavily indebted.</a> 00:18:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h18m24s">They created this thing called the National Debt, which grows year after year,</a> 00:18:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h18m28s">getting bigger and bigger,</a> 00:18:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h18m29s">to the great disgust and dismay of old-fashioned Republicans who have their</a> 00:18:29</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h18m35s">But the reason for the increase of the National Debt is obvious.</a> 00:18:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h18m39s">It is that with an expanding gross national product</a> 00:18:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h18m43s">there must be more and more money,</a> 00:18:43</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m02s">And I can refer you to the work of those who are,</a> 00:19:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m06s">but every idiot can see certain extremely fundamental principles in this</a> 00:19:06</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m12s">And I'm talking about the mindset today of a man named Robert Theobald</a> 00:19:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m17s">which roughly coincides with the general picture of people like McLuhan</a> 00:19:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m20s">and Buckminster Fuller in having</a> 00:19:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m23s">far-reaching thoughts and very adventurous thoughts</a> 00:19:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m27s">about what we should do with money.</a> 00:19:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m31s">But he's in the support of a man like Frederick Soddy,</a> 00:19:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m35s">who was a Nobel Prize chemist, who was one of the first people</a> 00:19:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m40s">to take a fresh look at economics.</a> 00:19:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m44s">Or people like Silvio Gesell in Austria</a> 00:19:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m47s">and Major Douglas in England, he is in that support.</a> 00:19:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h19m54s">And the proposal he brings forward is very simple,</a> 00:19:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m01s">that money is a circulation of information</a> 00:20:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m05s">and has no value in itself.</a> 00:20:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m09s">Of course, gold has some value. It has value for industry and value</a> 00:20:09</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m14s">for dentistry and value for jewelry.</a> 00:20:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m19s">But as a means of exchanging the goods and services in the world</a> 00:20:19</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m23s">it is just as primitive as</a> 00:20:23</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m29s">pack horses to carry the mail.</a> 00:20:29</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m40s">So we have to see that money</a> 00:20:40</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m44s">a pure abstraction.</a> 00:20:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m47s">I was back in a television program for a while</a> 00:20:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m50s">with Ted Sorensen</a> 00:20:50</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m54s">and Raymond Moley and they had this long, long discussion that sounded like</a> 00:20:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h20m59s">something that you can hear</a> 00:20:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m00s">in a smoke-filled back room of party bosses</a> 00:21:00</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m05s">where they talk about the prospects</a> 00:21:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m08s">for Republican Democratic parties in 1968.</a> 00:21:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m11s">And then they went further on the question of automation and the problems of</a> 00:21:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m15s">unemployment that caused it and the difficulties of it</a> 00:21:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m18s">the transfer of workers from here to there if they had only been trained for this.</a> 00:21:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m22s">In the end I said &quot;Your problem is that you still think that money</a> 00:21:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m25s">is genuine. &quot;</a> 00:21:25</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m27s">And they looked at me and said something like &quot;Oh ha ha ha someone who thinks that money is not real</a> 00:21:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m31s">is. Because everyone knows that</a> 00:21:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m33s">money is money and that it is very important. &quot;</a> 00:21:33</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m37s">But it is not really because it has the same relationship</a> 00:21:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m41s">real wealth, that is to say real goods and services,</a> 00:21:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m44s">that words have meaning - that words have to the physical world.</a> 00:21:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m49s">And as words are not of the physical world, money is not wealth.</a> 00:21:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m54s">It is only keeping available energy -</a> 00:21:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h21m58s">economic energy.</a> 00:21:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m02s">What happens now when you introduce technology to production?</a> 00:22:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m10s">You produce enormous quantities of goods with technological methods</a> 00:22:10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m15s">but at the same time you make people unemployed.</a> 00:22:15</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m20s">You can say &quot;Oh, but it always creates more jobs, there will always be more jobs.&quot;</a> 00:22:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m24s">Yes, but many of them will be useless jobs.</a> 00:22:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m28s">It will be jobs for making all sorts of nonsense</a> 00:22:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m32s">and unnecessary objects, and someone will also need the people at the same time</a> 00:22:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m37s">convince them that they need and want these things,</a> 00:22:37</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m39s">these completely unnecessary things that are not even beautiful.</a> 00:22:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m44s">And that is why there is an enormous amount of absurd work and activities</a> 00:22:44</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m47s">bureaucratic and different,</a> 00:22:47</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m49s">that must be made to keep people working,</a> 00:22:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m52s">because as good Protestants we believe that the devil</a> 00:22:52</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h22m59s">But the basic principle of the whole thing is completely overlooked,</a> 00:22:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m03s">that it is the purpose of the machine</a> 00:23:03</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m06s">to make such a plush unnecessary.</a> 00:23:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m11s">And if we do not allow it to fulfill its purpose</a> 00:23:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m14s">then we live in a constant state of self-frustration.</a> 00:23:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m18s">But then as a given factory</a> 00:23:18</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m22s">automates his factory and relieves his workforce</a> 00:23:22</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m27s">and they have to live on one</a> 00:23:27</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m30s">a considerably reduced income, say a kind of benefit</a> 00:23:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m36s">then the manufacturer suddenly finds that the public is not interested</a> 00:23:36</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m41s">buy products.</a> 00:23:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m44s">And that's why he invested in that expensive</a> 00:23:44</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m53s">And therefore, of course, the public must be given the means</a> 00:23:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h23m58s">with which they can buy what the machines produce.</a> 00:23:58</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h24m02s">People say &quot;That's not fair, where is the money to get away?</a> 00:24:02</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h24m06s">Who will have to pay for this? &quot;The answer is the machine.</a> 00:24:06</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h24m11s">The machine pays for it, because the machine</a> 00:24:11</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h24m14s">works for the manufacturer and the community.</a> 00:24:14</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h24m19s">This is not the same as saying that ah ... This is not it</a> 00:24:19</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h24m31s">that it is owned by the government.</a> 00:24:31</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h24m32s">It is only to say that the government</a> 00:24:32</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m17s">ah, give them money?</a> 00:25:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m21s">Yes. Because otherwise the machines can not work.</a> 00:25:21</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m28s">They arrive at a blockade. This was the situation with the Great Depression</a> 00:25:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m34s">when we still lived here, from a material point of view, in a very rich country</a> 00:25:34</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m39s">with more than enough fields and farms and mines and factories ...</a> 00:25:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m43s">everything at work. But suddenly because of a psychological compulsion,</a> 00:25:43</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m48s">by some mysterious hocus pocus</a> 00:25:48</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m51s">about the economy, about banking,</a> 00:25:51</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m55s">we were all miserable and poor.</a> 00:25:55</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h25m59s">Starving in the midst of plenty. Only by a psychological</a> 00:25:59</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m04s">compulsion. And that compulsive idea is that money is real. And that</a> 00:26:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m08s">people need to dabble to get it.</a> 00:26:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m13s">But the whole point of the machine is to spare you that splattering.</a> 00:26:13</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m17s">It is a resourcefulness. You see, we are psychological</a> 00:26:17</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m20s">back in the seventeenth century and technologically</a> 00:26:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m24s">in the twentieth. And here comes the problem.</a> 00:26:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m30s">So ah ...</a> 00:26:30</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m35s">What we have to figure out how to do</a> 00:26:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m38s">is changing the psychological attitude</a> 00:26:38</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m41s">compared to money and wealth and further pleasure</a> 00:26:41</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m45s">and even further to the nature of work.</a> 00:26:45</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m49s">And this is a formidable problem. It requires the best</a> 00:26:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m54s">brains in 'public relations', in propaganda,</a> 00:26:54</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h26m57s">in all that sort of thing, in all the media: television</a> 00:26:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m01s">radio, newspapers, everything ...</a> 00:27:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m04s">To try to convey the message</a> 00:27:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m08s">to the general public about what money really is.</a> 00:27:08</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m12s">The difficulty is this. When the public suspects</a> 00:27:12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m16s">that the money that is provided by the government</a> 00:27:16</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m20s">is only paper, and only stands for paper,</a> 00:27:20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m24s">then they throw up the prices so that you get a situation of inflation</a> 00:27:24</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m28s">where the more paper money there is, the higher and higher and higher the prices</a> 00:27:28</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m32s">to become.</a> 00:27:32</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m35s">What a very stupid psychological</a> 00:27:35</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m39s">reaction.</a> 00:27:39</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m42s">And people have to be persuaded.</a> 00:27:42</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m46s">The least effective way of tripping is to issue laws,</a> 00:27:46</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m49s">but they have to be persuaded in one way or another not to raise prices</a> 00:27:49</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m53s">but to be honest with each other</a> 00:27:53</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h27m57s">and a kind of standard</a> 00:27:57</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h28m01s">to hold between</a> 00:28:01</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h28m04s">how much is produced and how much credit</a> 00:28:04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU#t=00h28m08s">there is provided.</a> 00:28:08</p>
